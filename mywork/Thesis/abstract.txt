## Abstract

The technological advances in the field of autonomous vehicles are exponentially improving, with significant research efforts focused on achieving Level 5 automation through intelligent decision-making systems. The objective is to develop innovative and intelligent services for autonomous transportation that enhance safety, coordination, and efficiency in complex traffic environments. Current autonomous driving systems face substantial limitations when encountering unknown and unsafe traffic situations that require human-like reasoning capabilities, as traditional approaches rely heavily on pre-trained models and rule-based systems that often fail in novel scenarios not covered in their training datasets.

Accordingly, this thesis addresses the problem of intelligent decision-making in autonomous vehicles through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a multi-agent framework. The research focuses on two main categories: first, improving the reasoning capabilities of existing autonomous vehicle components, and second, developing intelligent communication systems that facilitate cooperative decision-making processes. Different research efforts have been exerted to tackle various aspects in the field of LLM-based autonomous driving systems.

At first, a comprehensive evaluation framework was developed to assess multiple LLM architectures including GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Falcon 3 7B, and several open-source models such as OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B and Google/flan-t5-large. The framework was tested under different traffic circumstances and conditions through text-based simulation scenarios, afterward, it was validated through carrying out controlled experiments analyzing decision consistency and accuracy across various models.

Next is the development of the multi-agent platform architecture, which consists of two primary components: the Decision Agent powered by LLMs and the Communication Agent that facilitates structured Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) information exchange. Each agent was equipped with specific capabilities - the Decision Agent for processing natural language descriptions of traffic scenarios and generating appropriate driving decisions, while the Communication Agent handles real-time data sharing about obstacles, traffic conditions, speed, and intended actions between nearby vehicles within a defined communication radius.

The research addresses two fundamental questions: (1) Can an LLM-based agent make effective decisions without undergoing specific learning processes for each new situation? (2) Is a single centralized decision-making agent sufficient, or does a multi-agent system provide superior efficiency and scalability when processing V2V communication data? Hundreds of experiments were carried out for the validation of each system component, testing scenarios ranging from basic traffic light recognition to complex multi-vehicle coordination challenges involving hidden obstacles and emergency situations.

The obtained results demonstrated the efficiency of LLMs to exhibit human-like reasoning in uncertain traffic situations, with decision accuracy significantly improving when contextual information from V2V communication is incorporated. Results proved the functionality of the multi-agent framework to make intelligent driving decisions with minimal pre-programmed knowledge, achieving consistent performance across diverse traffic scenarios. The Communication Agent enhanced the Decision Agent's contextual understanding by providing structured data, resulting in improved decision accuracy particularly in complex scenarios involving multiple vehicles and hidden information.

The research contributes to the development of more adaptive and intelligent autonomous driving systems capable of handling unpredictable real-world scenarios through the combination of natural language reasoning and collaborative multi-agent communication, paving the way toward safer and more reliable Level 5 autonomous vehicles.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The pursuit of fully autonomous vehicles represents one of the most challenging applications of artificial intelligence in real-world scenarios. While current autonomous driving systems have achieved remarkable success in controlled environments and well-defined scenarios, they continue to struggle with the inherent unpredictability of real-world traffic situations. The transition from Level 4 to Level 5 automation—where vehicles must operate safely in any condition without human intervention—requires systems capable of human-like reasoning and adaptability.

Traditional autonomous driving systems rely on pre-programmed rules, machine learning models trained on specific datasets, and reinforcement learning approaches. However, these systems face fundamental limitations when encountering novel situations not represented in their training data. Consider a scenario where traffic cones are positioned on a moving truck—a human driver intuitively understands that these cones pose no immediate threat, while a traditional AV system might misinterpret them as road obstacles requiring evasive action.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making across diverse domains. These models, trained on vast corpora of human knowledge and reasoning patterns, exhibit emergent abilities that suggest potential applications in autonomous driving scenarios requiring contextual understanding and adaptive decision-making.

### 1.2 Research Motivation

The motivation for this research stems from three critical observations in current autonomous driving technology:

**1. The Unknown-Unsafe Problem:** Current AV systems struggle with situations that are both unknown (not explicitly covered in training data) and potentially unsafe. These scenarios require the kind of common-sense reasoning that humans naturally apply but that traditional AI systems find challenging.

**2. Limited Contextual Communication:** While Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technologies exist, current implementations often lack the sophisticated contextual understanding necessary for complex decision-making in multi-vehicle scenarios.

**3. Scalability of Decision-Making:** As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, the question of whether centralized or distributed decision-making architectures will prove more effective becomes increasingly important.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This thesis aims to:

1. Investigate the feasibility of using LLMs as decision-making agents in autonomous vehicles
2. Develop a multi-agent framework that combines LLM-based reasoning with V2V communication
3. Evaluate the consistency and reliability of different LLMs in traffic decision-making scenarios
4. Assess the impact of contextual V2V communication on decision accuracy
5. Provide insights into the architectural requirements for LLM-based autonomous driving systems

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Autonomous Driving Systems Evolution

The development of autonomous driving systems has progressed through several generations of approaches. Early systems relied heavily on rule-based programming, where engineers attempted to codify traffic rules and driving behaviors into explicit algorithms. While effective for well-defined scenarios, these systems proved brittle when faced with unexpected situations.

The introduction of machine learning, particularly deep learning approaches, marked a significant advancement. Convolutional neural networks enabled better perception capabilities, while reinforcement learning provided frameworks for learning driving policies through trial and error. However, these approaches still required extensive training data and struggled with generalization to novel scenarios.

### 2.2 Large Language Models in Decision Making

Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making across diverse domains. Models like GPT-4, Claude, and various open-source alternatives have shown the ability to:

- Understand complex contextual information
- Apply common-sense reasoning
- Generate explanations for their decisions
- Adapt to new scenarios without explicit retraining

These capabilities suggest potential applications in autonomous driving, where contextual understanding and adaptive reasoning are crucial for handling unexpected situations.

### 2.3 Multi-Agent Systems in Autonomous Driving

Multi-agent systems have been explored in autonomous driving contexts primarily for coordination and communication between vehicles. Traditional approaches focus on information sharing about position, velocity, and intended actions. However, these systems typically lack sophisticated reasoning capabilities about the shared information.

The integration of LLMs into multi-agent frameworks represents a novel approach that could bridge the gap between raw data sharing and intelligent collaborative decision-making.

### 2.4 Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication

V2V communication technologies have matured significantly, with standardized protocols enabling real-time information exchange between vehicles. Current systems typically share structured data about vehicle state, detected obstacles, and traffic conditions. However, the interpretation and utilization of this information for decision-making remains limited in current implementations.

## 3. Problem Statement and Research Questions

### 3.1 Problem Statement

Current autonomous driving systems face critical limitations in handling unknown and potentially unsafe traffic situations. These limitations stem from their reliance on pre-trained models and rule-based approaches that cannot adequately address the full spectrum of real-world driving scenarios. The integration of human-like reasoning capabilities through Large Language Models, combined with enhanced vehicle-to-vehicle communication, presents a potential solution to these challenges.

### 3.2 Research Questions

This thesis addresses two primary research questions:

**Research Question 1:** Can an LLM-based agent make effective autonomous driving decisions without undergoing specific learning processes for each new situation?

**Research Question 2:** Is a single centralized decision-making agent sufficient to process all incoming V2V data and make autonomous driving decisions, or is a multi-agent system required for improved efficiency and scalability?

### 3.3 Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1:** LLMs can demonstrate human-like reasoning capabilities in autonomous driving scenarios, making appropriate decisions in novel traffic situations without specific training for those scenarios.

**Hypothesis 2:** A multi-agent system incorporating both decision-making and communication agents will provide superior performance compared to single-agent approaches, particularly in scenarios requiring contextual understanding of V2V communication data.

**Hypothesis 3:** The integration of structured V2V communication data will significantly improve the accuracy and consistency of LLM-based decision-making in autonomous vehicles.

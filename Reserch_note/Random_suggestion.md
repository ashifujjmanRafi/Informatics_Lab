The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) demands enhanced safety features, particularly in obstacle detection and avoidance. This research proposes the development of a multi-agent system (MAS) for real-time obstacle detection in EVs. The system will integrate multiple sensors and AI agents to process environmental data, enabling autonomous navigation while ensuring safety. By leveraging multi-agent systems, the proposed solution aims to improve the reliability and accuracy of obstacle detection, especially in complex urban environments.
Statement of the Problem
Current obstacle detection systems in EVs often rely on a single or limited sensor type, leading to limitations in accuracy and response time. These limitations are especially pronounced in adverse weather conditions, poor visibility, or complex urban scenarios with multiple moving obstacles. There is a critical need for a more robust and reliable system that can detect and avoid obstacles with higher precision.

Purpose of Research
The primary goal of this research is to design and implement a multi-agent system (MAS) for obstacle detection in EVs. This system will utilize a combination of sensors, including LIDAR, RADAR, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors, integrated through advanced sensor fusion techniques. Each agent within the MAS will be responsible for processing data from specific sensors and collaborating with other agents to achieve real-time, accurate obstacle detection and avoidance.

Background
Recent developments in autonomous driving technologies highlight the importance of obstacle detection systems. Current systems typically utilize a combination of LIDAR, RADAR, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles​​. However, these systems face challenges in harsh environmental conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow, as well as in urban areas with complex obstacles​​​​. Multi-agent systems, which involve multiple autonomous entities working together, offer a promising solution to these challenges by improving the reliability and efficiency of obstacle detection​​.


Description of Proposed Research

The proposed research will involve the following key steps:
Design of the Multi-Agent System: Each agent in the MAS will be designed to process data from a specific type of sensor (e.g., LIDAR, RADAR, cameras). The agents will communicate with each other to share and integrate their findings, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the environment.
Sensor Fusion and Data Processing: Advanced algorithms will be developed for sensor data fusion, enabling the system to overcome the limitations of individual sensors. Techniques such as machine learning will be employed to enhance the accuracy of obstacle detection in real-time​​​​.
Simulation and Testing: The performance of the MAS will be evaluated in simulated environments that mimic real-world driving conditions. Various scenarios, including adverse weather and complex urban settings, will be tested to ensure the system's robustness.
Implementation and Optimization: Based on the simulation results, the MAS will be implemented in a prototype EV. Continuous optimization will be conducted to improve the system's efficiency and reduce computational overhead​​.

Conclusion
The development of a multi-agent system for obstacle detection in EVs represents a significant advancement in autonomous vehicle safety. By integrating multiple sensors and processing data collaboratively, the proposed system aims to provide more accurate and reliable obstacle detection, especially in challenging driving conditions. This research will contribute to the broader field of autonomous driving and enhance the safety and efficiency of EVs.

Traditional OCR vs. LLM-based OCR
Traditional OCR: This involves multiple steps: image preprocessing, text segmentation, character recognition, and text reconstruction. It can be error-prone, especially with complex images or handwritten text.   
LLM-based OCR: LLMs, trained on vast amounts of text and image data, can directly process images and extract text.1 This can potentially improve accuracy, especially in challenging conditions.1   



**less complex and human like reasoning** we present an autonomous vehicular system based on multi-agents to reduce the complexity of the autonomous system. In fact, instead of executing several tasks by one process, we split them between different agents. Therefore, this complexity reduction reduces the execution time and provide a quick intervention in complex scenarios. Furthermore, our multi-agent system can be applied for all vehicular brands. In contradictory to the existing systems that were dedicated to specific brands.

## 23.11.13

yes sensei last day was cold also. and i have
two class to attend , one was in the morning
at 8.00 am and the another was at 12.45 ,
that was your class.

## 23.11.14

writing research note is essential to remember to what happed
last time and to remember the task we were assign
last time. we can write anything that sensei suggested for
practacing.

Sensei tell us that at the beganing it will be
difficult for us, and suggested to upgrade our typing speed,
and strongly suggested to writhing the research note. sometimes we
might we fail to write down some research note then
today is not yesterday , sometime we have to write
everything , that will be good practice, and strongly suggested
to the past note. last day he forgot to write
down his notes, he also write the past notes. wheather
he remembers. suggest to put a date and write whatever
we remember. asked us to write last date research note
and not to be worried about past days and suggested
to practice from now on. sensei showing us to how
to write note propely.

**Poster presentation**
Sort time to describe the poster, and content is important
, poster should be self contained, and understadable to the
audience. Sabbir vai asked how to make understand the audience
the background story?
Sensei told to prepare some live demonstration, or movies atlest
prepare some laptop or tab.Sabbir san asked sensei to demonstrate
a poster presentation,Sensei suggested to search some university poster presentation.
Sensei mention about UMBC university.

Next thursday is national holiday.<br>
[Workshop_on_Informatics](https://sites.google.com/view/winf2023/home),Deadline-last of this month.

Sensei suggested to take all classes before next march.13-14 of
next january there will be entrance exam and we are
strictly prohabited in campus.suggested to present on the presentation.
Sensei reviwed sabbir sans paper comment.

- [x] Sensei told us to convert our research proposal
to IEEE format and
- [x] Take research note properly.


## 23.11.28

**Conference && presentation GuideLine**
IIAI 2023 conference after the workshop.
Practice poster presentation as early as possible,and suggested sabbir san
to start pesenting the poster. Practice to find the right
content that should indicate the research theme.
Do plan before write slide for any presentation otherwise that
can miss some checking.
**Getting a plan is important before doing anything and thinking
about what i am going to do** Research notes are
important for improving to update the research things or anything
assigned and this can be helpfull for the juniors for
understading the situation how gonna the research should operate or
any details about the situations.<br>**Before preparing slide for the presentation
we need to do a proper plan, important thing is
to getting a little bit prepare for the actual presentation.**
In conference presentation we dont have share our actual planning
wheather we can share our planning after 6 months or
after graduate what we gonnna do.Make some summarization about our
presentation and what question can be asked is a good
thing before presenataion,-getting comment from slack channel and answerig them
can be a good way to preparaing for presenatation and
we have to do crosscheck with our actual content.
**To iftekhar san :** get comment from the audience can
they relate the content with the actual theme or not.
Some text explanation in poster is ok, some poster are
for only for presentation and some poster need a presenter,
ours gonna be secenond one.

## 23.11.29

I was sick today , my pressure gone high ,
i rested whole day.

## 23.11.30

Today i have the first exam experience at japan ,
it was nihongo midterm exam. Though my preparation was not
so good but i tried so hard and it is
a relif. And i had only one class and then
came to dormitory and cooked for myself.

## 23.12.1

I got an arubaito and today i have scheduled 7
to 11 am , then i have done my prayer
at 12 pm and then i have a class at
12.45 and i joined that. There was a group presentation
and my role was to time management , in which
slide how much time need to use and which slide
is just to show i tried to plan this out.

## 23.12.2

Saturday i tried to practice some nihongo , and watch
one episode of "Jujutshu kaisen". I cooked for myself at
night and practice nihongo at duolingo.

## 23.12.3

Sunday there was no class , i woke up at
10 and try to learn some nihongo. And also i
tried to solve a problem in leetcode but it seems
hard and i became disapointeed and started watching a anime
"Tokyo Revenge"

## 23.12.4

I have some work in eki , i wake up
early and went to eki. Then i have a class
or Data engineering but the class was cancelled at the
last moment, i was in the class and wait sometime
, then i have another class at 2.25, and make
a group and choose a topic and in next class
we do have a .


## 23.12.5

**Sabbir San :** Presentation slided , at first page Add
subject name and mention all the authors who helped to
make sucess the research. Add more slides to explain some
more things. **Poster presentation time is like 1 min, the
main idea is to explain**, if someone asked more, there
we could use more time.
The main objective of his research is to identify an
auction based approch that helps to create a paraller task
allocation schedule vased one task preference and path collision avoidance.
- [ ] Novel methods can be developed to proactivity
detect and resolve and collision between robots in real time
during task allocatin and execution.
- [ ] Finding effective way to priotize tasks in
multi robot task allocation system.
- [ ] How the path planning algorithms be intregated.

At my understading it should be in this way like
first problem statement -> Impletementation Design -> Limitation and Conclusion.

**Suma san :**Where to park the car? managing overstaying vehicles
in parking lots , optimising efficiency of path planning :
algorithm is used vest path finging algorithm
**Practice over and over untill it match the time expectation**

## 23.12.6

I have only one class today programming language, i missed
two lecture, i tried to catch up , Sensei also
give a review. I noted some key point and i
think i can catch up. After the calss i came
back home and tried to solve a problem in leetcode.
And also practice some nihongo.

## 23.12.7

There was a nihongo class at 8.40 . I have
joined it and i think

## 23.12.8

I have done my prayer at 12 pm and then
i have a class at 12.45 and i joined that.
There was a session about yamaha company a guest lectuare
tried to expline japanease work culture, hows important is mental
health and how many holiday i can got after getting
job. And there was a Session that says what gonna
excite me in workspace.

## 23.12.9

I got an arubaito and today i have scheduled 9
to 2 pm, it was my first day without any
trainer , it was hard undersatand their command but soon
i catch up and it was a great experience.

## 23.12.10

Today there was an workshop Workshop_on_Informatics , many student was
gathered most of them were japnease and some internatinal student.
I went there and three of my senior presented their
idea. Sabbir san, Shuvo san and Suma san. Sabbir sans
idea is to develope a sytem where multiple robot on
a supershop or factory can work under a centralized administration,
if any task is assigned the robots will decide itself
which work it will to based on shortest path finding
avoiding collision with other robot , and if multiple task
and multiple robot are assign they will do the same
, first calculate for whom its efficient and then do
the job, his presentation tittle was **Parallel Task Allocation in
Multi-robot Environment under Uncertainty based on Auction Mechanism**. Next i
visit suma san and her idea is to solve parking
problem in parking lot according individuals choice. Basically she introduced
a problem where if anyone wanted to park a car
several issue arise like someone wants to park beside the
main exit or close to bathroom, and how to manage
those car which are parked for a long time and
another thing if two or more car wanted to park
in same which one get more priority. I think solving
this problem is little bit tricky because our mind changes
certainly.
Then i visi shuvo san, his idea is to find
a path for electic viacle with available charging point based
on if there is available point acoording my car battery
life , can i use them or not because there
will be a advance booking system. If there is more
choice that satisfy the first condition then choose the sortest
path. His idea is cool i think because i think
in future there will be more electrical viacle and we
need this kind of app or system. I also tried
to understand other japanease students idea but their idea was
written on japanease that i beraly understand and i asked
if they can explain their idea but that dosnt work
out. The presentation was closed at 2.15 and i came
back to my room. It was really a great experience.

## 23.12.11

I have two classes today one was cancelled Data engineering
and another class was in 2.25 pm and i have
group presentation , describe a cyber attack happen in my
country. I made a three page presentation about the incident
Bangladesh bank Money heigst happend in 2016.


## 23.12.12

International conference presentation is about 20 min. Sensei suggested sabbir
san to to find out those question background those he
get in wiNF by himself. The most question was like,
**why he use centralized auctioner insted of decentralized** In his
research he planned conduct it **centralized auction based system** because
he were planning to use a centralized server that will
be responsible for task allocation and path planning.

**How many robot you are planning to simulate in your
model and if he simulate them how he is gonna
do that** Initially his planning is to make a simulation
based on few number of robot. After the simulation he
will compare it with other researcher model and then take
the decision.
Or this can be we gonna run multiple simulation taking
different number of robot like 5 then 10 then 15
and we will compare the result and then we can
go ahead to our actual planning.
**some ask about how to conduct the experiment, ask the
evaluation technique**
Dont have to answer every question according out instinct, without
backgruound knowledge its better not to answer all the question
rather we can clarify what we can do about out
experience.
**There should some limitation describe in the presentation slide** not
own limitation but the limitation of the research. **answering the
question , change the the slide to relevent slide and
then answer the question,**

Sensei told to try to submit research proposal to a
international conference once, and for 2nd grade student its the
last chance.
IIAI AAI 2024: [https://iaiai.org/conference/aai2024/]
shuvo san: **Reasearch note** are not only about success but
also about how the failure happen otherwise it can be
happen again and again. Research notes are about how to
carrying out the research, what problem are we facing like
this kind of things. The research discussion with Iftekhar san,
the notes on the scheen , we will start from
the research summary. He said that the meeting was started
from the research summary and finding some conference for submitting
the paper that he needs. Sensei does not see any
effort from the research notes, and Ifetekhar said that he
had some difficulties from the job hunting activities, such as
the web test or SPI and also finding some companies.
Sensei said that at least please also write those things
to be the written in the research notes, and yeah
I think it is also important even it is not
related to the research. Sensei said, okay we will try
to write from now but in 3 weeks with no
research notes, it is not a short times.
Writing wrong fact or misslead factor, in research note is
prohabited.

## 24.2.20 *LM*

Sensei says not to come campus on next sunday. Next
week sensei will go nogoya as well as hokkaido, may
be he will cancel the tour and the session can
run ok . And next next week 5 march maybe
there will no meeting or the relocation the meeting time.
And Next month sensei have some bisuness trip, and there
will some relocationg of session time. And in 12 march
there will be no meeting because there will be an
entering exam, and for busy schedule may be there will
be no relocation of the meeting. This is the briefing
of schedule of this month and next month. And april
there will be deadline for the internationl conference.

Todays meeting started with suma san. Sensei asked her what
are the issue is she facing according her research and
job hunting issue, that will be very helpful for masters
first grade student.
obstacle in the parking lots? while we are making a
simulation of basic parking lot where new obstacle may be
face, like we can skip complicated obstacle. Suma san actually
facing the problem about visualization, like who are going to
get benifits.
Fairness in resource allocation and fairness while 2 persons have
same problem - who getting beinifits
- We may not be clear/have no way to analyze
what is actually happening. To analyse what is happening we
should know
- If we apply some reinforcement tech-then the log data
may be small.
- If the output data is small, then we may
not worry about the visualisation.
- We don't know where to start is the difference
between bachelors and masters.
In Masters course there will be some complicated terms and
experiment and thats why sensei is there to help us,
but first students must leam something so they give us
enough chances. And then we have discussions We may first
have to have failures while doing something to learn. But
those failures is good for better learning.
Suma san have some issue including fairness after discussion with
kawai san, like how does the fairness can be conducted
ex in case someone disable and a pregnant women and
first camer driver in a parking lot how does it
can be determine whos gonna take the parking space> what
is completely unfair? in some cases we clearly see what
is unfair and how we can adjust them.

I was trying to read some basic concept of simulation,
like what is simulation , the creation of a model
than can be manipulated logically to decide how the physical
world works, simulation answer questions.
Also trying to read nihongo, trying to understand basic conversation
skill.
- I am confused about my research, As I don't
have any previous experience in research. After joining meetings and
reading some papers of our lab members, I found a
pattern of addressing a distinct challenge related to the domain
of interest. They propose a specific problem, followed by presenting
a solution or comparing their ideas with previous work. I
understand the importance of having a specific problem statement in
my proposal ? However, I'm unsure about how to identify
such a problem or what steps I should take in
this situation.

## 24.2.27 *LM*

Next week sensei will go nogoya as well as hokkaido,
may be he will cancel the tour and the session
can run ok . And next next week 5 march
maybe there will no meeting or the relocation the meeting
time. And Next month sensei have some bisuness trip, and
there will some relocationg of session time. And in 12
march there will be no meeting because there will be
an entering exam, and for busy schedule may be there
will be no relocation of the meeting.

Talking with **sabbir san** : IN His code he assigned
static object randomly as it was a room model and
movable object have a free position. Based on pygame library
function he already assign some time interval and based on
these time Interval our movable object run one place to
another place
he also assign some static path for movable object.
Based on his current simsulation scenario, he can reproduce an
updated version from here like updated version should include some
static obstacle in random position or fleed position. he want
to have also some fixed path for moving olject from
one place to another place in this current situation without
collision avoidance our movable object running smoot

situation

To avond the deadinck issue we have actually two options,
The
- We can use some deadlock avoidance agorthm
- We can do nothing for this deadlock condition
Sabbir san wanted to use aution mechanism for his simulation,
and sensei suggested that if deadlock situation happen maybe that
will be care of another way not help of aution
mechanism, because aution mechanism is not used for this type
of problem.
- It can be haldle manually , like we can
told in the code like if/else condition, and no need
to think about it right now.
- what can be happen if we try to do
something,

Talking with **shuvo san** :
For His simulation need to code for range prediction. he
has some issues with making code and he tried to
find this kind of code.He thinks next step is range
prediction but it's not correct, after range prediction, he will
try to do the best CS selection step. This is
his maybe he may have other issue but he does
not clearly understand it.

In my proposed model, I mentioned multiple agents will be
designed to perform specific tasks related to traffic control, such
as traffic flow prediction, congestion detection, traffic signal optimization,
and *accident identification*.<br>
Thease can be a individual probelm to solve.Like now i
thinking to narrow the initial problem statement, this thing i
am planning as sevaral module ,
In first module there will be done traffic flow prediction
for an x street, <br>
Then second module , ??<br>
For Smart traffic light control, Initially it will be controlled
with perspective of two value time and number of cars,following
x waiting time.How to done it dynamically?

Next week there will be no meeting.
**Disscussion with me** <br>
Research is not a problem solving, When we do some
problem solving we do some research. The main focus is
to learn from the lab.Sometime strong belive is not correct.For
now it is ok for learning new things. But in
some case it should have some counter question,arguments.
Research question doesn't mean problem statement- For understading the research
.
Ask others about most effective way is important,
What can we do for it? - what can we
for some specification statement?
Difference between mockup and handsketch or ppt- From the mockup
we can think different perspective, and the research question will
be understandable by everyone.

When we want to learn something new we should be
confused, if i always beleive on my own belief maybe
its not right all the time. I would be confused
untill passed masters grade.

Talk with toufik san:

## 24.5.13

I am trying to solve one problem from leetcode everyday.
From the last meeting sensei suggested to make a mockup
for the research for better understanding, and other perspective can
be arise some good research question.
Not using ppt!
He also suggested not to use ppt for mockup, i
asked my seniors they have done their mockup using ppt,
i am planning to doing it using pygame and now
i am trying to understand the basic concept of pygame
first. I was seeing a journal,"Smart Traffic Light Using YOLO
Based Camera
with Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" i saw some figures and
got an modeling idea for my mockup but i am
not sure about it.



## 24.5.14

Next Next week our meeting will be skiped. From 28
there will be a conference JASAI, sensei will be busy.
From june our meeting will be just on time.

About **Research Note**:
The thing i remember from the last time, **Reasearch note**
are not only about success but also about how the
failure happen otherwise it can be happen again and again.
Research notes are about how to carrying out the research,
what problem are we facing like this kind of things.
Sensei said that at least please also write those things
to be the written in the research notes, and yeah
I think it is also important even it is not
related to the research. Sensei said, okay we will try
to write from now but in 3 weeks with no
research notes, it is not a short times.
Writing wrong fact or misslead factor, in research note is
prohabited.

Sensei told to **Toufik san** :
As a human being we cant remember all that happen
with us with date and time, but if we write
down everything maybe we can recall.
Also writing research note we can monitor our work we
are doing , if its blank it can make ourself
ashamed that we havent done anything, Its a reminder for
us that how much time we are giving in research
prerspective.
Reading a paper and we should to write it on
research note, and if we are confusion about anything thats
a problem we can talk about with sensei.
Sensein suggested not to read some paper not to understan
something, and those paper have some concreate goal.
Result part have no connection with mockup, we have some
expected result. And sensei suggested,
***Dont beleive in your beleving***
In the **conclusion part** two thing can be mentioned like
, what result we are expecting, what we are dreaming
to do and the result we will actually get from
the result. At my understaning Research never concluded, it can
and will be improved continiously. In conclusion sort clear goal.

**Disscussion with me:**
Simpler desing for mockup, text base or rectangle, for initial
mockup. Maybe in later time animation can be the final
mockup. When we can do some text base mockup ,
we can also do more clear visualization. For now text
base mockup is best thing.I thought maybe its the final
mockup , that was the problem.
Writing something on my paper can relax me ,**sometime doing
parallal work is good thing.**
Expected situation is to see the expanded time for the
greater cognation side of the road and it
What the other aspect we can think of about traffic
management ?
what can be done for high speed car ?
For emergency case like ambulance passing what can be done
in traffic management ?

Data from some road?

## 24.5.15

I have nihongo class, then i came home tried to
read a paper. I have arubaito from 5 to 10
pm.

## 24.5.16

I have two classes and some assignments to submit today.

i have two assignment deadline one i have completed last
night, the others i would complete now. I have another
program to atten at 4pm about job hunting, HICE. I
have joined a seminar about job searching, what should i
keep in mind for searching a job. One of the
most important thing i learn today if i have enough
skill to communicate in japanease job hunting will be easy.
Then i came back to lab.
I planned to make a initial mockup today. After finishing
the initial mockup i have had some discuss with Takahashi
san.

I have two classes today, i missed the nihongo class.
Then i went to the lab, tried to do something
about my research. I have tried to read some related
random papers, To search some question that can be arise
in my research also. Sensei give some hint last week
like,

- For the drunk drivers how it is helpfull to
follow the lights?
- Mid Night drivers drive rushly, can something be done
about it?
- Can the accident be reduced ? or accident can
be identified?
- After accident the emergency help time can be reduced?
- Can the collide car or rule breaking car can
be identified through this system?
- Traffic police or man power what will their role?
- If weather collapse like heavy rain or snowfall how
does the system react?

assignment but i didnt understand , and i asked takahashi
san to help me and there was a disscussion meeting
around 1 p.m to 3 pm for the Information organization
class. In this week there was seven assignments, too much
pressure. And then nigongo practice so many things.
About my research i am trying to read a paper,"Multiagent
Decision Making For Maritime Traffic Management"
As far i can think of some research question,
- For the drunk drivers how it is helpfull to
follow the lights?
- Mid Night drivers drive rushly, can something be done
about it?
- Can the accident be reduced ? or accident can
be identified?
- what can a agent do after accident?
- After accident the emergency help time can be reduced?
- Can the collide car or rule breaking car can
be identified through this system?
- Traffic police or man power what will their role?
- If weather collapse like heavy rain or snowfall how
does the system react?


## 24.6.4 **LAB MEETING**

From next week sensei will have class at 4pm, From
next meeting there will be divided into two time one
will be same as this time and another will start
from 5.40 pm. Last meeting was about domestic conference, Sensei
was working as local organizing,

**Telling others people about the research- dont try too much
to make them understand rather try to show some mockup
or work or prove what you are doing. And explain
your condition and you are unable to speak in japanease
in japanease they will understand that atleast you are practicing.**

## 24.6.5

Today i have nihongo class and there is a job
fair in the afternoon . And i am planning to
go there, i meet several compinies Suzuki , senkei as
my understanding now i should focus on nihongo much. Then
i came to lab and tried to do some problem
solving. this semester there are too many assignments, like everyday
has atleast one or two assignment.

## 24.6.6

There are two classes in the morning. I missed one
cause i am not feeling well. I have two assignments
deadline to meet today. About research i am trying to
search some new paper. Tomorrow i have nihongo class test
i tried to practice so hard , this semester there
is so much pressure and in couldnt fully concentrate to
nihongo, i find it hard to leave something for next
day.

## 24.6.7

Today i have nihongo class test, it was hard for
me i hardly can pass in this exam, now i
understand a little nihongo but for reading and speaking i
have to practice more and more. Then i have arubaito
from 5pm to 10pm.

## 24.6.10

Today is monday, i have two classes and two assignment
to submit. I missed the nihongo class last night i
slept late , the assignments was much hard to crack.
I came to lab after finishing the class. And i
am planning to apply for a schoolarship, i tried to
fill the documents and i asked mizutani san for help.
Then i tried to read a report "A traffic light
control method based on multi‐agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm".
And i tried to write the abstraction and conclusion in
my paper.

## 24.6.11 **LAB MEETING**

**Recap from the last meeting(24.5.14) and my current situation:**
Sensei suggested to do creat initial mockup, and practice parallal
working. sensei give some hint about, i was not clear
last day about current situation like expected resul would be
not only to see the expandaed time for the greater
cognation side of the road. also suggested to think other
aspect can be think about traffic management.

I am thinking about some research question,
- For the drunk drivers how it is helpfull to
follow the lights?
- Mid Night drivers drive rushly, can something be done
about it?
- Can the accident be reduced ? or accident can
be identified?
- what can a agent do after accident?
- After accident the emergency help time can be reduced?
- Can the collide car or rule breaking car can
be identified through this system?
- Traffic police or man power what will their role?
- If weather collapse like heavy rain or snowfall how
does the system react?

Next meetings update,

This meeting will go on till 3.50 and then if
it is necessary the meeting will be continued againg from
5.45.
**About Thesis:** sensei suggested not to use microsoft doc, which
Style? The best way to start writing theasis is not
to think about it rather started writhing, In thesis it
is important what i have i done not what have
accomplished or the explanation.
Sensei suggested to think about research question daily not more
than one hour quontiniously.

Presentation of Suma San:
What is fair allocation? Fair allocation - FOF
Need basis fairness, Group fairness, Hybrid approches combines mulple fairnaess
criteria or integrate them with other objectives such as efficiency
or overall welfare.
Difficulty of determinig fairness?
A decision that seems fair and equitable to one group
may be viewed as unfair by other - this is
drawback
- Can LLM effectively determine the fairness?
- as input the situation as natural language explanation go
as the input and as ouput natural language
- No proper judgement from the top used LLM
- About the simulation in what basis according to fairness
- need basis fairness?
- OLLAMA - Promt engineering as input please tell in
one word that is it fair or not
- Main movite for this research how the LLM response
to the fiarness and unfairness.

The main purpose of AI is to thinking as like
human, Is it really possible to achive fairness through LLM?

Suggestion : how difficulties we faces doing the researches it
can be included

Presentation of shuvo San:
working on charging place allocation uning multi agent there is
two part
- Imagine we are going somewhere from hamamatsu to tokoyo
on a electric viacle. And we can be sort of
bettery.how is that situation. this paper introduces a smart charging
navigation system for long distance EV travels.

Presentation of sabbir san:
Parallal task allocation in multi robot environment based on auction
mechanism with deadlock constrains.
Imagine in automated warehouse where various types of robots are
responsible for different tasks, such as picking items from shelves,
transporting them to packing stations, and managing inventory. each robot
is equipped with specific capabilities and is tasked with performing
multiple jobs in parallel to optimize productivity. The challenge arises
when multiple robots need to access the same narrow aisle
or pick items from the same shelf simultaneously, leading to
potential deadlocks and inefficiencies.
This paper we are working to achive parallal task allocation
in multi robot environment erasing deadlock situation using auction mechanism.
we are trying to find some deadlock situation and tried
to suggest some algorithm for we have used itterative auction
mechanism.

## 24.07.23 **Lab meeting**

Disscussion with soma san:
Her problem is that she cant use ollama in some
cases(with the mac mini in the lab), in order to
run some large model like command r plus And when
in tried to run via LMStudio which is prepared unig
vnc. I cant use the copy paste function. As i
need to give the input of car parking situation s
generated she can t use this models.
So the things she confirmed for this issues, capy paste
of virtual lmstudio is disabled becauses of the option s
she have selected while installing.
- the large models which are unable to run via
alllama is the issue of ollama, so even if she
wants to observe some data from there.

Disscussion with sabbbir san:
**What is your controbution to your work or your research?**
How many approch you have tried to solve dead lock
situation.
- we can prepare one or more approch for the
research and then compare the result and show it and
can say which one is better and our originality.

Disscussion with shuvo san:


About research contribution, As far disscussion with sabbir san i
think we should compare our approch with some existing approch
that will prove our contribution.
**May be seeing the potential of multiagent system in the
booking sytem and the optimal route selection.**


**Discussion with me:**
Tittle for my presentation - "Toward a Multi-Agent Approach for
Dynamic Traffic Control and Optimization"
my interest for now is to seeing the potentiality of
multi agent system for post accident senario.

Think about the EV- automatic cars for obstacle detection.

## 24.07.24

I followed sensei's hint and searching some papers on obstacle
detection for automatic vechile.
"3D Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars using a
Multi-Camera System: Calibration, Mapping,
Localization, and Obstacle Detection"
Keywords: Fisheye Camera, Multi-camera System, Calibration, Mapping,
Localization, Obstacle Detection
This paper mainly focuses on the ability to sense cars
surroundings, the 3D variant of this problem : estimating the
3D structure of the environment around the car and exploiting
it for tasks such as visual localization and obstacle detection.

## 24.07.25

The problem with my current research that research questions actually
have the potentiality to being researched. I tried to read
another paper,
"Real-Time Multi-obstacle Detection and Tracking Using a Vision Sensor for
Autonomous Vehicle"

## 24.07.26

"Detecting Unexpected Obstacles for Self-Driving Cars:
Fusing Deep Learning and Geometric Modeling" [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06573) - <br>
addressed problem with a vision system that leverages appearance, contextual
as well as geometric cues.

## 24.07.26

Investigating Driving Interactions: A Robust Multi-Agent Simulation
Framework for Autonomous Vehicles, [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04720)

Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Collision Avoidance of Autonomous Driving System for Vulnerable Road
User Safety [link](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/10/1952)
The hybrid A* path searching algorithm is first applied to
calculate a pre-defined path marked by waypoints, and a low-level
path-following controller is used under cases where no VRUs are
detected. Upon detection of any VRUs, however, a high-level DRL
collision avoidance controller is activated to prompt the vehicle to
either decelerate or change its trajectory to prevent potential collisions.

## 24.07.29
Obstacle detection and avoidance for automated vehicle: a review, [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12596-020-00676-6#Abs1)
:One of the initial approaches was by using ultrasonic sensors
and laser range scanner and was adopted with acceptable accuracy.
But as the camera applications geared up with their advances
in types and sophistications, a pair of camera or stereo
vision has geared up for this application.
"Multiple Obstacle Detection for Assistance Driver System Using Deep Neural
Networks :" [link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24271-8_45)
they propose a deep convolutional networks for solving the online
multiple obstacles detection problem. The method consists of deep visual
information extraction and visual pattern learning. They are modeled as
deep Convolution Neural Networks, which are able to learn discriminative
visual features for obstacle detection and model inter-object relations in
an asymmetric way and give the orientation extraction for the
moving obstacles.
"Obstacle Detection and Distance Estimation for Autonomous Electric Vehicle Using
Stereo Vision and DNN": [link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-3393-4_65)
This can be achieved in multitude of ways such as
using passive sensors like camera and applying vision algorithms on
their data or using active sensors like RADAR, LIDAR, time
of flight (TOF). Active sensors are costly and not suitable
for use in academic and research purposes. Since we have
advanced computational platforms and optimized vision algorithms, we can make
use of low-cost vision sensors to capture images in real
time and map the surroundings of an automobile. In this
paper, we tried to implement stereo vision on autonomous electric
vehicle for obstacle detection and distance estimation.

I have one class of software engineering today, there is
a last assignment.

In last week i got hint from sensei and i
tried to read some paper about that topic. My current
situation is i am confused that i asked suma san
, takahashi san about the hint.have sensei give me the
hint for changing the research theme, soma san replied she
was actually busy with her thesis last week and didn't
followed much.
Takahashi san said sensei taught me about importance of "WHAT"
and "curiosity".
Sensei knows "curiosity" of research community and can judge your
research topic would be accepted or not so welcome.And also
said he didnt take enough volume of note to remember
the details of you and sensei's last discussion.

For now i am confused ? i find more curiousity
with this theme of obstacle detection for self driving vehicle
.

## 24.07.30 **Lab Meeting**

29-31 august there will be mid term presentation, this could
be early morning schedule. September first week sensei will have
an workshop in hiroshima prefecture.

Discussion with me :
He is very confused.
Sensei question - What kind of issues he has about
his research title.
Instead of saying - what should you do => change
"should" to "can" i.e., what can i do
He thought he would get some ideas from the papers
=> so, he started to read them.
Before reading those papers, did you prepare some questions on
reading those papers?
Why are you willing to have the brief summary of
the content of the paper - the summary is already
there in the abstract. You can directly copy and paste
the abstract if you just want a summary. It is
very easy and accurate.
Before making a checklist it is also necessary to check
the background of the paper like where it comes from
- don't read papers randomly.
Where this paper comes (the paper he is reading now)
. how you reached this paper. Why do you believe
this paper is nice to read?
Don't search your papers. See papers that come from top
conferences.
Usually people search by keywords, but recently published papers don't
include the keywords.
The one he is reading is not a research paper
rather a summary of what is happening in the field.
From such things we don't have any way on how
to organize our research.
Instead of searching - see the recently published state-of-art.
What issues are you having in your presentation title?
Your research title is very general but doesn't include the
details of your research. So, I told you in the
last lab meeting to concentrate on the details of your
research.
The issue is - we mentioned nothing more details.
The situation in different cases is different. How many cases/scenarios
are you written in your research?
He showed some questions but still these are less detailed
and very general - for eg, reg drunk and drive
- are they having family/nt, what kind of car he
is driving etc.,
When you ask someone about these details then they can
answer or give some more details to you.
Those details can be utilized to do some mock ups.
It is necessary to clearly evaluate those all ⅞ instance
cases.

For mockup first think about the detailed senario, like What
kind of car, the Road details.

## 25.07.31

The classes are over, in this week there are three
last assignment for this semester.

## 24.08.1

In last meeting we talked about the situations and i
wanted to chage my research theme but sensei told that
i should work on the research questions first like make
more detatils about the senario, that i am working on
currently, The research question currently i am focusing on
- Can the accident be prevented ? or accident can
be identified?

How a multi-agent system (MAS) can help for real-time accident
preventation or obstacle detaction in **autonomous car**.

## 24.08.2

In in my home country a civil war is happening
between the unarmed students vs armed government army. Many innocent
people are dying , this happening for like half of
a month. But for now it happenig so brutally and
many of my friends got died and injured in the
protest. I am not feeling well mentally.

## 24.08.5

Today Bangladesh got victory against the facist government and so
many unwanting event is happening in my country. I am
happy and sad at the same time.

Last meeting summary:
What issues are you having in your presentation title? -The
issue is - we mentioned nothing more details.
The situation in different cases is different. How many cases/scenarios
are written in my research
- some questions but still these are less detailed and
very general
- for eg, reg drunk and drive - are they
having family/nt, what kind of car he is driving etc.,
- When you ask someone about these details then they
can answer or give some more details to you.


## 24.08.6 **LAB MEETING**

Our midterm presentation might be happen in 29 august at
the morning shift.

With multi agent approch even we cant decide this approch
is optimal for the solution.
Last meeting summary:
What issues are you having in your presentation title?
- we mentioned nothing more details about the research senario.
- How a multi-agent system (MAS) can help in real-time
accident preventation or obstacle detaction for autonomous car.
Next question, how can we do it? having seen some
example, We need some complete example senario. After seen some
complete senario then we can genaralize them. After genaralizing them
then i can find some way to solve the senario.
How can we do some detailed senario for them ?
Thinking about good example is not easy, dont try to
produce from your imagination, it would harm.
If you worry about your future,
Having some short disscussion with others
another way is only observing by yourself, if you find
something them take memo.
when we try to make good example we should start
from bad example. Try a little better example step by
step.

Talking with soma san:
What i actually want to doing with obstacle detection like
only detecting the obstacle, because there has been some technology
they have already detecting the obstacle.
- the existing obstacle detection technology has some range
- i am wanting to detect obstacle for autonomous cars
for accurate finding
- next existing obstacle detection technology, how do they operate
- what are the obstacle detection technology for autonomous
- what i really wanted to do after detecting the
obstacle
- it can be used post accident senario to alrming
the upcoming cars: then there should be inter communication system.
- Obstacle detection for parking lot: normal car can detect
obstacle in parking lot how
- i can detect obstacle then what?
-

## 24.08.7

ADAS- Advance

- Level 0: No Automation: The driver performs all driving
tasks.
- Level 1: Driver Assistance: The vehicle can assist with
one or more driving functions (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane
departure warning).
- Level 2: Partial Automation: The vehicle can combine two
or more driving functions (e.g., adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping
assist), but the driver must remain engaged and ready to
take control.
- Level 3: Conditional Automation: The vehicle can handle all
aspects of driving in certain conditions, but the driver must
be ready to take control when requested.
- Level 4: High Automation: The vehicle can handle all
aspects of driving in most conditions, but human intervention may
still be necessary in some situations.
- Level 5: Full Automation: The vehicle can handle all
driving tasks under all conditions without human intervention.

While the concept of a fully autonomous vehicle (Level 5
on the SAE scale) is captivating, the reality is that
we are not there yet.

**Research Question:**
1. Addressing complex ethical scenarios that autonomous vehicles may encounter,
such as choosing between different potential victims in a collision.For
example, an autonomous vehicle might need to decide whether to
swerve to avoid hitting a pedestrian, potentially risking a collision
with oncoming traffic.

Challanges for now:
- Sensor Fusion: multi-sensor data fusion, sensor calibration, sensor uncertainty
- Perception: object detection, object tracking, semantic segmentation
- Path Planning and Control: motion planning, trajectory generation, vehicle
dynamics
- Human-Machine Interaction: human-robot interaction, driver behavior, trust
- Simulation and Testing: virtual environments, simulation platforms, hardware-in-the-loop

Definition of **sensor fusion** in the ai context: In the
AI context, sensor fusion epitomizes the cross-disciplinary approach of combining
information from diverse sensors – such as cameras, radars, LiDAR,
and ultrasonic sensors – to create a unified, comprehensive understanding
of the environment. By fusing data from these varied sources,
AI systems can foster higher levels of situational awareness and
decision-making capabilities

## 24.08.8

Challanges:
1. Detecting small objects like children, debris, or potholes can
be challenging, especially at higher speeds.
2. Incorrectly identifying objects as obstacles (false positives) or failing
to detect actual obstacles (false negatives) can lead to safety
issues.
3. Effectively combining data from multiple sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar)
to improve detection accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.
4.

## 24.08.12
About Waymo, Before our Waymo Driver begins operating in a
new area, we first map the territory with incredible detail,
from lane markers to stop signs to curbs and crosswalks.
Then, instead of relying solely on external data such as
GPS which can lose signal strength, the Waymo Driver uses
these highly detailed custom maps, matched with real-time sensor data,
to determine its exact road location at all times.

Lidar:
Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, paints a 3D picture
of the vehicle's surroundings. Lidar sensors are located all around
the vehicle in order to send millions of laser pulses
in all directions, then measure how long it takes for
them to bounce back off objects. No matter the time
of day, our lidar system gives the Waymo Driver a
bird's eye view of what's around.

Camera:
Our cameras give the Waymo Driver a simultaneous 360° view
around the vehicle. They are designed with high dynamic range
and thermal stability, to see in both daylight and low-light
conditions, and tackle more complex environments. They can spot traffic
lights, construction zones, and other scene objects, even from hundreds
of meters away. There are 29 cameras on our Jaguar
I-PACEs.

Radar:
Radar uses millimeter wave frequencies to provide the Waymo Driver
with crucial details like an object's distance and speed. Radar
is effective in rain, fog, and snow.

Brain:
As the "brain" of the Waymo Driver, our onboard computer
combines the latest server-grade CPUs and GPUs. It takes information
provided by dozens of sensors on the car, identifies the
different objects (like other cars and pedestrians), and plans a
safe route towards your destination – all in real time.


First what i am planning to doning -> research background
-> research motivation -> motivation senario? ->

## 24.08.13

Sensor fusion is a main challange for dteecting obstacle and
here in proposing multi agent approch like output from different
sensor will be haldled by multiple agents and a certralized
agent will take the main decision.


## 24.08.14

How an LLM-based system could potentially handle this:

1. Context Integration: The LLM could integrate information from multiple
sources (visual inputs, traffic rules, construction zone protocols) to understand
the overall context.
2. Reasoning: It could reason about the hierarchy of traffic
controls (e.g., worker gestures may override malfunctioning lights).
3. Generalization: Even if not explicitly trained on this exact
scenario, the LLM could generalize from its knowledge of traffic
rules, construction zones, and safety protocols.
4. Human-like Interpretation: It could interpret the construction worker's gestures
in the context of road work, even if they're not
standard traffic signals.
5. Cautious Approach: The LLM could generate a conservative plan
that prioritizes safety, such as slowing down, attempting to establish
clear communication with the worker, and proceeding with extreme caution.
6. Explanation Generation: The LLM could provide clear reasoning for
its decisions, which could be crucial for post-incident analysis or
real-time communication with passengers.


## 24.08.15

Why multiagent is our choice?
- Each agent focuses on a specific task (e.g., object
detection, path planning), making them highly efficient.
- In a multi-agent system, decision-making is distributed across several
agents, reducing the risk of a single point of failure
and allowing the system to respond more flexibly to changing
conditions.
- Agents can collaborate, sharing information and coordinating their actions
to achieve a common goal.
-

## 24.08.16

I am trying to make a presentation that includes a
novel approach to autonomous driving systems by integrating a Large
Language Model (LLM) as the main decision-making agent within a
multi-agent framework.
And i about the senarion i am thinking about false
positive and false negative.


## 24.08.19

Last meeting recap: we mentioned nothing more details about the
research senario,how can we do it? having seen some example,
We need some complete example senario. After seen some complete
senario then we can genaralize them. After genaralizing them then
i can find some way to solve the senario.
How can we do some detailed senario for them ?
Thinking about good example is not easy,dont try to produce
from your imagination, it would harm.
If you worry about your future,Having some short disscussion with
others.

Short discussion with soma san:
What i actually want to doing with obstacle detection like
only detecting the obstacle, because there has been some technology
they have already detecting the obstacle.
- the existing obstacle detection technology has some range
- i am wanting to detect obstacle for autonomous cars
for accurate finding, then what?
- next existing obstacle detection technology, how do they operate
- what are the obstacle detection technology for autonomous
- what i really wanted to do after detecting the
obstacle


## 24.08.20 **LAB MEETING**

My current situation, I have prepared a presentation, the senario
is kind of
a case of partial road construction or maintenance, that I
often I see in road in japan , some pepole
uses red and white flag to make signal its ok
to pass or not they block the maintaince part with
traffic cones.
What we human do in this kind of situation, -
We use our common sense and pass through safe side.
What a AV might do in this situation? -A typical
autonomous vehicle (AV) might see the "STOP" sign and barriers
and immediately come to a complete stop. It might interpret
this as a full road closure, based on its pre-trained
data.

Some informatin for near future,
Next tuesday sensei is busy, there will be no meeting.
Next wendesday, 8/28
**About the thesis**, there would be 3 submission date first
is for comment from other sensei this could be change
but submission to the administration the submission time are very
firmly, then the version would be submitted to the campus
file system this is prior final then if the commite
will decide wheater it is ok or not. If it
is ok then there will be no submission, otherwise there
would be a final submission.


## 24.08.28

What toufik san really want to do is not mentioned
in his presentation, sensei asked
"have you mentioned many supportive work and why you dont
argue, are not market traders arent take any helps from
others"
Distinguish between the belief and something is confirmed.
About the research isses where is the prove that you

**CARLA** has been developed from the ground up to support
development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems.
CARLA: In addition to its core features, CARLA offers a
framework for integrating V2X communication, allowing developers to simulate interactions
between vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians.
AirSim: AirSim also provides support for V2X communication, enabling the
creation of more realistic and complex urban environments.

## 24.08.29

About the question my goal: clear why using LLM ,
In such kind of scenario data driven model cant take
decision what should to include human like reasoning we want
to include LLM

## 24.09.6

I reached home safely. this week there would be no
lab meeting.

## 24.09.09


## 24.09.16

There is a upcoming conference and important dates,
Paper Submission: October 31, 2024
Notification: November 15, 2024
Authors Registration: November 30, 2024
Cameraready (ICT Paper Authors): November 30, 2024
Cameraready (INT Paper Authors): December 31, 2024
ΙΙΑΙ ΑΑΙ 2024-Winter Congress: December 16- 18

What kind of paper i should prepare for this conference?

todays meeting was postponded as sensei mentioned in last meeting.

## 24.09.17

## 24.09.18

## 24.09.19

## 24.09.23

I tried to write the introduction part of the research.
I am follwing our seniors paper.
For now my issue is what kind of paper i
sould prepare for the upcoming conference and what should included.

## 24.09.24 **Lab Meeting**

Toufik san: sensei suggested to make simplified simulation and mockups
for the reserarch for better understading the final output.

The theme is changed and now i have to write
the conclusion.
About the registration, First writing the conclusion and some reference.
What kind of detailed question i have then sensei can
give some feedback.I have to write atleast 4 pages paper.



## 26.09.24

## 1.10.24 **LAB MEETING**

For last two day there is a uncertain flood happening
near my location, No continious electricity for preventing unwanted accident.
I started the conclusion, this is my current situation.


## 23.10.24

I am going back japan and in didnt join this
lab meeting.

## 25.10.24

I just reached japan, i am trying to update my
research paper soon i will upload this to the slack
channel.
I am so much tired and sick this is my
current sitution.

## 27.10.24

I am sick, i got fever may be the weather
is changing thats why, i am taking rest actually. I
asked toufik san and other first grade student about last
lab meeting they told me sensei only talked with toufik
san about how to write research note and asked him
to make simulation for his work. Sensei also tell something
about paper to toufik san but they remember not much.

## 28.10.24

I am not fully well still, i planned to going
on lab and have some small talk with takahashi san
but i couldnt make it. I am writing research background
now. ANnd planning to write also the methodology but maybe
i should disscussed it with sensei first. Next meeting i
will ask him. If i feel good tomorrow i will
talk to takahashi san also.

## 29.10.24
Suggestion from takahasi san:
- More example is one idea to fullfillin the paper
requirements.
- about contribution of multiagent system for communication between vechiels
think about VICS,
-

## 30.10.24

Avoiding word like innovation,
13:14 Rafiさんの話
Why we use LaTeX is that, for every conference, they
have a specific format of LaTeX.
教員はM1の留学生にも今日から書き始めろと指導した。
結論から書け。逆向きから書くという方法があるということを知っていること、それだけでも意味がある。
Conclusion can be written only by first author, while other
part can be written by rest authors.
That's why we write papers from conclusion.
Here you are saying about innovation.
f. Can you define what is innovation?
r. Preparing solution?
f. Umm. So without having progress of technics? ...no.
Innovation という単語は研究ではなくて、ビジネスの世界で使われることが多い。
f. Knowing which terms are used in which field is
important.
(introduction of "Make it Stick" book)
(to 1st grade M students)Since the time of master cource
is limited,
I will strongly recommend you to start writing your paper
at beginning of your cource.
How produce a paper is important regardless what output is.
Top conference: actual presentation deadline will come next May, while
full paper submission is this month.
There is gap between submission and presentation.
Instead of that, **conferences** of IEEE (excluding A class one)
are good challange for master grade students.
Ofcource, you(Rafi) can try this!
Which conference we are going to submit is other important
issue.
(introduction of "IIAI AAI winter 2024" conference)
f. Length of paper is very important.
- 1st priority is writing up enough length of paper
and then improve the quality.
- Don't use generative AI to write your paper.
- Don't copy and paste from other researches.
Sensei has been undertaking the risk of being included on
the papers as the co-author.
(If first author's behabiour is not consice, next year students
might be rejected too)

(Continue reading Rafi's paper(especially on conclusion part))
Solution -> Solution is not a progress technically.
Then to show something about it, we gonna show something
regarding it.
e.g. we can obtain some level of benefit or drawback
from LLM??
human-like reasoning?
Conclusion must be a conclusion. Answer must be included.
Most efficient way to brabrabra... is writing conclusion without any
knowledge
and have such kind of discussion.
(for 1st grade master students)Start writing to start thinking about
your research.
**repeated cycles** process of thinking about your research (not a
single cicle of doing) is helpful.
Immidietly after you submit your paper, you can start next
conference submitting paper.
Very actively working studnets did so.
He submit both of conference and workshop.
About figure, you should use copy licensed figure.

Why we have to submit international conference?
f. There are some reasons. One of them is final
reviewers might not be a expert of the field
and that is why they want to see some evidence
to prove your paper has been accepted
by the community members of related field.
---
(Re-show his plan presentation)
f. You showed somewhat difference between yours and current researches.
"Unsafe-unknown", in such a case... (missed)
possible issue on experiments:
Are these unknown situations really unknown to us?
What happens on agents is really unknown.
During learning process, learning agents does not gain information.
You(Rafi) does not seem to want to do such approach.
f. What can we do?
f. Ask LLM directly?
Can be solution?:
If we could ask LLM and quickly build up experiment
situation based on its answer,
then we can make situation event it's very difficult to
realize.
f. Actually undergraduate student is trying to create child behavior.
In Japan, elementary school students go to school without any
help by parents. Unexpected behavior of children.
f. Limitation: prepare unknown situation was hard.
So we made **potentially unknown situation to agents** even while
designer of the experiment already know about the situation.
rest is what would be future work.
f. example story: child follows a ball
f. Then go to detailed question
like this: "how to reproduce it in the simulation environment"?
Having some kind of prototypes / mockup to reproduce what
we can reproduce situation.
e.g. zebra mark, passing person, children, etc. ← text representation
is also OK.
You can write it as research objective saying what we
will do next is ???
Writing program for experiment is another good point to start
from.



In paper dont writing sort form like dont or wont
-> do not.

## 1.11.24
- i will include the explanation of unknown unsafe
- then some scenarions
- limitation and future work
- making some test case and result from gpt and
add the images to the paper.
-
Unknow-unsafe scenarios why complicated,
Happen without warning
Require immediate decision-making
Often combine multiple challenges at once
May not have been experienced before by the driver
Can overwhelm normal driving responses

## 4.11.24

At 2nd november the conference deadline is closed maybe this
time i can not submit my paper.

## 5.11.24

About my research what i can do now actually this
is my goes with my current situation.


## 6.11.24 **Lab meeting**

**Last lab meeting summerization:** Some good advices for everyone actually,
LaTeX is used because each conference requires a specific format,
so it's best to start learning it early. It's helpful
to start with the conclusion because it gives direction for
the rest of the paper.Sensei advised first-year master's students to
start writing their papers now. Start writing early to help
you think more deeply about your research.There are some reasons.
One of them is final reviewers might not be a
expert of the field and that is why they want
to see some evidence to prove your paper has been
accepted by the community members of related field.
- About figure, you should use copy licensed figure.
- Are these unknown situations really unknown to us?
What happens on agents is really unknown.
During learning process, learning agents does not gain information.
- Limitation: prepare unknown situation was hard.

**Toufik san:** Last time what disscussion happent to him, last
time its about the research note - how to write
research note, what should do readng new research paper. Then
sensei suggest him to make him some simulation about his
research
- what kind of mockup we have in my research
- for example apple store based on some example
- then sensein suggest him to prepare him to make
some mockup

In last last meeting i was not present, Sensei told
about the importance of thinking about "what i can do
insted of what should i do"
We should think about what can we do. Sensei suggested
him about some conclusion but toufik snas imaginary conclusion is
far different from it. He is being stick with his
believe without any confirm evidence. Its a serious problem. About
sabbir san he believe his paper include problem formualation and
conclusion should include some.
Sensei suggested the first grade student to taking digital note
insted of physical note, and still some of them taking
note in physical manner, this is same situation with toufik
san believing their own believe.

Summerize about the last meeting that could conclude what is
the confusion, this could be helpful to push you further.
For toufik sans metter the confusion is coming from the
feeling thats why its hard to explain his current situaiton.
He is thinking who whould be the user? Dont mix
what is happening in market, but the marketers dont thinking
about this rather that thinking what can be improve. Rather
think about your procedures or alternatives what improvement can be
done. We are thinking like the marketers which option would
be best from this 3 examples.

- thinking about the viewpoint of the users is very
difficult. From the users side we dont want the best
one, better one is ok. But as the producer we
want the best solution. Checking all the possible other ideas.
- Sensei suggested him to make a simulation for the
first conditon, for a single buyer. And strongly suggest him
to it from now.
- For the second case, the reviewers get gift card
that will calculated buy a agent they will also get
a discount. When the buyers going to buy phone after
seeing the review, they will set a trashold value for
buying the phone. Buyers and reviewers are different? - why
- We have invistigate the--MISSED , the future is evaluating
the-- MISSED


Disscussion with new students,
Suggenstion from toufik san, Sensei suggested to update the research
continiously note because it can be memorized, there should be
a plan it can be changed but it just go
on
- try to write nearly everything in research note
- making point would make less time to write the
explanataion.
- Sensei suggested to use keybord to writing the note
and ask some others if they miss something to taking
note.

** Some Notice: **
Next saturday there will happen some event sensei suggested to
join them.
There would be undergradute plan presenation in next thursday.
Entering exam for japanese student, where we cant come in
campus.

## 7.11.24

Have some disscussion with toufik san and takahashi san about
toufik sans research how can he explain his objective and
he wrote some code as sensei suggested.

## 8.11.24

About my research the IIAI conference i intended to submit
my paper, the date is over . Then i have
to be prepared for next conference.

## 11.11.24

Last updated research paper i tried to update some point
that sensei suggested,
- I tried to include the explanation of unknown unsafe
- Then i added some new examples
- Limitation and future work, sensei give me some hint
- I planned to making some test case and result
from gpt and add the images to the paper, but
this was undone.

## 12.11.24

About my research i have updated my paper and didnt
get any comment from sensei. For now i am waiting
for some comment from sensei and then in next stage
what can be done is the question.

## 13.11.24 **Lab meeting**

**Last lab meeting summerization:** Some good advices for everyone actually,

What happens on agents is really unknown.

- Limitation: prepare unknown situation was hard.

**Disscussion with Sensei:**
Next thinking about some prototype, We really dont know our
research outcome right now this is current issue?
The first step is to start writing code about the
car crashing,
How can we make some knowledge to the cars,

Note from Hasan san, Firstly sensei listen rafi san's present
situation, sensei said sorry to him. Sensei told unknown situation
for car that is known to human . then sensei
, told him to make prototype. He ask to sensei
, what type of prototype he can make, then sensei
told to follow mock up. First of all write some
code that show some known and unknown situation . then
next step is prototype to final simulation.In Implementation some situation
with the code , though it hard but start to
first some specific situation implementation,and it can be written in
paper. And also listing up the worries topics that can
be shown to sensei. If we stuck in some situation
then we should left it for that time and reading
some top conference papers. About it. Sensei emphasize to write
research note.

## 14.11.24

Have some disscussion with toufik san and takahashi san about
toufik sans research how can he explain his objective and
he wrote some code as sensei suggested.

## 15.11.24

About my research the IIAI conference i intended to submit
my paper, the date is over . Then i have
to be prepared for next conference.


## 19.11.24

About my research i have updated my paper and didnt
get any comment from sensei. For now i am waiting
for some comment from sensei and then in next stage
what can be done is the question in last lab
meeting i have started thinking about coding as the mockup.
My confusion is why dont use a simulator like carla
where the road situations are like real life wheres i
am thinking to get some unknown senarios suggestions from the
LLM. Then first i should start writing code for the
initial then i can get suggestion from sensei.


## 20.11.24 **Lab meeting**

Last lab meeting summerization: Sensei suggested me to do some
prototype, From very beganing like car is running in a
road then add some obstacle or accident senarios.
Simulate a car moving along a straight road with no
interruptions. Focus on ensuring the car follows basic traffic rules,
such as maintaining lane discipline and appropriate speed.

**Disscussion with toufik san:** What is important is starting from
this one is easy for us then next step which
part is updated - for initial part we used three
categories of discount. In second step calculating some number from
the random numbe. In scenarion section why you put some
difficult portion. 7% off is given to the fist week
selling customer, How the income is related to this? sensei
didnt mentioned about the income in the second step he
added this. Toufik san believe that it would be more
compitable with real world wheres sensei suggest him to make
simplified model. (About the treshold value i am not understanding)
When we think about complicated model -- we would think
more simplified modeling though you can think it may be
not be real world.
And you have noticed coming to this point you had
face difficult moments thats why research is not easy.
Again we are going to make this income as treshold.
then he is counting the person in the treshold then
what the calculation do?
Their concern is the income of the seller. It is
not focused to the buyer. Why dont you collect the
data of the buyer. Why dont you calculated total sell
from the seller? How much we can get from the
selling that is our concern why dont you collect the
data. This is the repeted disscussion whenever you see real
life example you are satisfied.
Whats happening here you are not seeing the number you
making realistic not randomly. When we rely on our feeling
the output we want is more realstic, thats why we
need to practice? while practicing we are not intend to
going to the final step directly.
Underline efforts is not easy, actually he have to fighting
against his felling its not easy.
First randomly --
You can calculate the discount ratio on it.
we gonna see the second scenario, in second scenario he
also didnt calculated the selling. Number customers who reviewers -
whats missing? When you want you give some discount to
the top reviewers this can violate the rules.
In scenarios three, there are also three promotional offer, in
this you are giving discount to the people who is
using this media users why dont directly giving the money
to the company.--
Having some disscussion with other research doing person talking with,
how they are doing this could be nice to overcome
with natural feeling.
The disscussion could be so serious to us to relax
maybe the laboratory devices can relax us, what would be
next step in your word - he can simplify think
about the model.
The next step is to calculating the sellers income and
add some treshold for the buyers.
Sensei suggestins, you can write a simple code in simple
way throw away the real world. Even now hasan san
is thinking about real world thats what preventing him to
write a simple code .
you can write a simple code although it wont reflect
the real world. Only writing the keyword may confuses you
wheather we want it or not.
While we are doing research we cant say which direction
is right or wrong. Also next step could be writing
this to your research paper.
Wheathers we confused about our content in our research paper
is it ok or not. Thats why we need some
comment from the reviewrs from the outside is nice. Dont
expect to accept your paper in your initial version.

Even we the know importance though its difficult for us
to do that. Sensei suggested the M1 to start writing
their paper.

## 21.11.24

As last meeting i got some suggestion for making prototype
of the mockup from the scratch and i write a
code today that only a car manully can go forward
and break and also can go right and left.

## 22.11.24

Today after finishing prayer i came to lab for upgrading
the prototype in v2 i am going to add one
feature the car can go forward dynamically. Today i tried
to do that may be i need some time for
finish this. Sensei suggested me that after this i can
add some features about some obstacles and so on.

## 25.11.24

About research i havent upgrade my prototype yet, still i
am trying so many things happening acctually, mentally i am
bit upset cant doing daily things.

## 26.11.24

I have tried to make a prototype where a single
car in going forward dynamically.

## 27.11.24 **LAB MEETING Disscussion with me **

Last lab meeting summerization: Sensei suggested me to do some
prototype, From very beganing like car is running in a
road then add some obstacle or accident senarios.
Simulate a car moving along a straight road with no
interruptions. Focus on ensuring the car follows basic traffic rules,
such as maintaining lane discipline and appropriate speed.


Next step simulator: We would like to make these simulation
ready for LLM, When the car is going and not
having anything
Implementing some obstacle and going through this may be good
for some senarios. We
Next may be make some promt for LLM, hey LLM
whats happening here.
Two following car one see the stop sing and stop
and ask LLM what should the following car do? And
adding some promt for the following car. What this car
should do? Then check the LLMs reaction. And then check
the answer.
In my paper This simple text base scenario, and asking
LLM.
Connection between the simulator And the LLM - some disscussion
with undergrad student

**Note from Tauhid san:** Rafi-san told about his last discussion
that sensei told him to make about prototypes. Rafi-san showed
his prototype. Sensei told Rafi-san to make more simpler porotype
as his prototype was bit complex. Sensei is happy with
the prototype and asked him about his questions. Rafi-san asked
sensei how can he take LLM decision. Sensei suggested him
to take screenshot and asked him to implement the simulator
with some character. Rafi-san asked sensei about CARLA simulator. In
CARLA they already have a framework. Sensei asked him to
show details about CARLA in website. Sensei - we don't
know the validity about the CARLA simulation, whether its for
research purpose or developed by some company. Takahashi - a
paper related CARLA simulation was published in collaboration of Intel
and TOYOTA. Sensei- as there is a paper so it
may have some validation. sensei suggested Rafi san to choose
the simulator independently and afterwards ask questions to sensei, so
we may know the simulators are doing and how they
works. There is trade offs that we have to go
through the codes thoroughly which is very hectic and time
consuming so sensei suggested to try new techniques. we can
decide the kind of simulator by adding some more in
the prospect. how LLM can capture the correct data. what
are we going to do, we don't have a clear
prospect so we need to try different simulations to identify
the correct one. we must be careful about the tradeoffs
while selecting a simulator. So better to have a own
simple simulator. Before starting the simulation we worry about so
many things and therefore we are here. And these can
be happen with us and we must fight against our
own feeling. One thing is clear we should ready the
simulation for LLM and for unknown situations. In the simplest
case car going straight is okay. the potholes must be
detected by the car, detecting obstacles and go through it
is one kind of scenarios, will the car go through
the obstacle or stop ask the LLM.LLM prompts - one
car going through, one car stops, what should the next
car do? or car changing the direction what the next
car should do. Think about the global scenarios. sensei told
us about one of his such events. Are you worrying
about writing some paper. You can add this things in
the paper. Then why didn't you do it before 3-4
months back. Rafi san - I was thinking about what
should I do then. We can use some powerful computers
to implement the LLM. Some undergraduate students implemented the relation
of LLM and powerful machine. We must have some Japanese
kill to discuss with Japanese students. Japanese students are getting
very little chance to show their speaking skills as they
are not asked about their English skill in the entrance
exam. We must have learned much Japanese last one year.
We must regularly practice Japanese to develop our Japanese skill.
The right Japanese skill is very powerful. You told about
a good amount of issues. We must not stop writing
research note in the meeting. It is hard translate some
Japanese as there is no specific meaning in English. Bringing
own drinks very important because it is very dry in
winter. Try to enjoy this season. Enjoy the scenic view
oh Hamamatsu.

## 28.11.24

In the last lab meeting, i got some comment from
sensei
- We would like to make these simulation ready for
LLM
- Implementing some obstacle and going through this may be
good for some senarios.
- Having some disscussion with the others would be good
-


## 29.11.24

I went to lab today, after finising my prayer i
was plannig to think about my research, now i am
thinking about the prototype where the problem can be clearly
identified. Two car will colide in certain circumtances. I am
plannig to join a job fair in the afternoon, maybe.

## 02.12.24

I am sick i cant move my neck, thats why
i lay down whole day.

## 03.12.24

Todat the neck pain is less still i am not
feeling well.

## 04.12.24 **LAB Meeting**

**Disscussion with Toufik San:** Sensei asked toufik san what was
the last disscussion and toufik san mentioned about the disscussion
but there is no evidence about this, and asked him
why he didnt ask someone
for their notes. then Sensei asked his why didnt he
do that, why is he just following his strictly follow
his pesonal beleive. Then he replied he collected usually notes
from others but last time it seems he had understad
what sensei said. thats why he didnt ask.
What should be done only thats is written, what sensei
suggested toufik san to use the text editor to make
the research note but toufik san is not convinced.
Now toufik san successfully added his research note in text
base. Toufik san at first he tried to use text
base note but somehow he lost his data thats why
started using google docs.

Sensei asked toufik san about the new finding from the
others note, and suggested him to highlight some notes that
whould be efficient for understanding what was his last disscussion.
And he successfully he started thinking how he could reach
next step not what would be the next step.

## 5.12.24

I have to make a simulation that can be a
input for the LLM, Now what can i do i
can check suma sans research documents for getting some idea.

## 6.12.24

Today is friday, after completing my prayer i came to
room. Started thinking about how can be the simulation can
be updated. I have some neck pain, i checked the
pressure and its high.

## 9.12.24

I am so much tired for last two days i
have done arubatio for like 18 hours, i am feeling
not to do anything today. Also i have to go
to Shizuoka tomorrow.

## 10.12.24

I have joined a job event in shizuoka, a company
visit. It was a different experience we mistakenly brought the
local trains ticket and faced most heptic train journey in
my life.

## 11.12.24 **LAB MEETING Disscussion with me:**

**Last meeting Disscussion summarization:**
In the last lab meeting, i got some comment from
sensei
- We would like to make these simulation ready for
LLM
- Implementing some obstacle and going through this may be
good for some senarios.
- Having some disscussion with the others would be good

My current situation for last one week i am feeling
neck pain and i am so much puzzaled and tensed
about job hunting and couldnt fully concentrate in my research
tough i am feeling to do something avout my research.
For now what can i do now.

**Some Upcoming informatin:** Sensei suggested to be careful about the
infuelansa, this season the the air is too cold.

We have a road and we have a car,what happen
in our mind when we think its very simple to
be done we dont do rather we think more difficult
thing and when started work we couldnt complete, we fail.
We sould do start from the simple way , dont
skip the easiest one. Easy task skip, skip, skip, find
difficult task, and then we just stop there.
Thoroughout the process, nothing have done.
What we think right now, the LLM can understand the
complex scenarios but we are not sure whatever the LLM
can understand the most easiest scenarios and can give expected
output or not.


For japnease learning to make some note and try to
speak it. Live conversation is most difficult, and most easiest
way is to make memo what you want to say
and say it again and again.

**Note from Takahashi san :** 20241211
13:17 Rafiさんの話
He created a very great simulation program.
f. Extending too much simulation what happen?
r. It is not best in order to create input
to LLM.
(...after short talk)
f. First, research issue, and then go job hunting matter.
r. OK.
f. What kind of simulation are you going to implement?
r. Similar one with Sumasan ← Why don't you do
it?
Easy task skip, skip, skip, find difficult task, and then
we just stop there (=stack / pitfall).
Thoroughout the process, nothing have done.
Issue is just changing your simulation design into something LLM
can understand.
Just change your design. Once you start to do it,
then you can do it.
Facing the serious situation is important in master cource.
Unfortunately, other students cannot know how serious it is.
Learning Japanese is same manner just preparing Japanese sentences.
Don't skip easy thing. Utilize AI multilingal translation.
Show up content on your computer what you are willing
and then Japanese will give hints.
(Rafi san has already prepared text-representation of simulation environment)
pasting text representation onto chat box of GPT-4o and ask
him to whether he can understand it or not.
Then, LLM gave so complicated answer far from expectation.
f. add to prompt this "just answer STOP or FORWARD".
After updating prompt, LLM answered "STOP".
NP problem is different.
After noticing the problem, whether other problem's answer does not
help another problem answer.
↑ ????
To whole students.
Share your knowledge about something related to research; for example
prompt engineerina.
Others' insight can be helpful even if they don't have
deep understandings on your specific research domain.
(↓some detail may missing)
Auto training E-to-E those company are developing AI to acheive
that.
We don't have any cars! don't worry.
Utilize small LLMs can work well.
When receiving answer from LLMs which looks good, you don't
stop there
but you have to think what the exact one you
are willing to have and continue to ask.

**Note from Touhid san:** 11 December 2024 Wednesday
Sensei discussion with Rafi-san
Rafi-san discussed about the last meeting. Sensei told him about
the last demonstrated model was very nice.
Rafi-san told sensei that he was sick last week his
blood pressure was a bit high. Sensei asked him about
the progress of this week and told hom that the
previous simulation was too much complex.
*Rafi-san said this simulation is okay for visualisation but not
okay for LLM.*
Then Rafi-san told sensei about the job fair recently he
visited and how was it and he also added that
he talked about the versity recommendation with shirai sensei.
Rafi-san also told us about his company visit previous day.
Sensei told us that these issues are also very important
for us and we must continue learning Japanese language and
increase proficiency.
Rafi-san told that he is puzzled about the current situation
and feeling great pressure and can't stable his mind. Sensei
asked him about making a simpliest simulation. Rafi-san told us
about suma-san thesis and how she implemented the code so
Rafi-san also wants to make a similar kind of simulation.
The point of msater's course is to face these type
of difficult situations. Similarly we the first year master's student
should also understand the pressure what Rafi-san going through.
Sensei also suggested him to practice talking in japanese with
japanese students. Rafi-san said he tries to speak in japanese
but he faces difficulties in speaking Japanese so Sensei suggested
him to use the smartphone and AI. Rafi-san also showed
us how he is practicing Japanese using AI.
He also told us about he sometimes don't understand the
short forms of japanese in the conversation. Sensei asked us
to start with the simple japanese words. So sensei suggested
us to prepare the converstion brforehand so that we can
speak fluently. We can have the similar kind of conversation
more then once and so it will be easier for
us in similar conversation we do. We can record some
converstions for learning in the future. We are living in
the era where we have many resources to learn. Rafi-san
agreed and added that we also have many things to
distract our focus in the wrong direction. Sensei again started
discussing about RAfi-sans research. Sensei asked Rafi-san to use Ai
to simulate a sitution regarding his research. Sensei asked rafi-san
to promt different situation the GPT. Sensei asked him to
modify the promt as it was written the natural language.
This time the answer was right. So sensei told us
that from this we can understand that what kind of
command we need to put next and this is how
we can use AI. AI is also working in a
similar way as it is based on LLM so we
can use it in some context but sometimes it is
not easy. So sharing knowledge is very important. When we
findnew things we must share it with others and research
laboratory is such things. We can share experience with others
which will also increase our experience. Sensei asked our japanese
lab mates about the prompt engineering. Using generative AI in
live converstions may be very effective in generating new ideas.
Sensei told us about a group who are are trying
to solve similar problem. At this point we are focusing
on the car scenario so we must focus on LLM
like bicycle or human scenario. SO we must not skip
the necessary simple things and think about the kind of
answer we want. Sensei discussion with japanese students.
Sensei asked us to visit Nagoya castle which is much
bigger then Hamamatsu castle and Kyoto.

**Note from Fahmidul san** Today, Sensei discussed with Rafi-san that
first Sensei tell him to briefly summarize the last discussion
with him.Then Sensei again asked him what kind of issue
he faces right now. He said he had a high-pressure
problem.Sensei again asked, Please explain the details about so many.
Rafi-san attended a job fair last week. Rafi-san is confused
about everything.
Sensei told us this information is also important for other
students. Now Sensei is going to start a research-related discussion.
Sensei told us that in our minds, easy steps we
didn't follow, we just skipped that we worked the hardest
thing, but we should think of easy steps first. What
is important in a master's course to face some difficult
situations? Rafi san has one year of experience. We have
to fight against our deep feelings. Sensei asked him did
he do it. Practice speaking Japanese with AI. Now he
shows us he discussed with ChatGPT in Japanese. We are
always going to start in the simplest way. For Japanese
learning, make some notes and try to speak it.
At the job-hunting program, we should prepare some basic Japanese
sentences to speak with them.Practice speaking the same thing twice
or more. Don't skip the easy thing. We are living
in 2024, and 2025 is coming . We don't live
in the 19th century; now we have computers and the
internet. Don't start with the hardest way. Sensei told Rafi-san
to ask ChatGPT for some traffic-related signs' explanations. Sensei again
told Rafi-san to ask ChatGPT to Please answer STOP or
FORWARD. To get the right answer, ask the direct question.Once
we find them, then we can utilize them easily.Once we
found any unique things, we should share them with others.Other
students don't have any knowledge about our research. Now, Sensei
asks this question with some Japanese students in the Japanese
language. Sensei speaks Japanese very fast. Sensei asked Takahashi-san is
he noticed what Rafi-san did. Rafi-san didn't expect ChatGPT's answer.
Don't skip the necessary things. Even we receive simple answers.
Now Sensei discussed with Mizutanikun-san in the Japanese language.

## 12.12.24

I have to make a simulation that can be a
input for the LLM, Now what can i do i
can check suma sans research documents for getting some idea.

## 13.12.24

Today is friday, after completing my prayer i came to
room. Started thinking about how can be the simulation can
be updated. I have some neck pain, i checked the
pressure and its high.

## 16.12.24

I am so much tired for last two days i
have done arubatio for like 18 hours, i am feeling
not to do anything today.

## 17.12.24

I have try to create prototype and there were some
error and now i am trying to solve those error.
Maybe next week i gonna show some output.

## 18.12.24 **LAB Meeting**

Disscussion with Toufik san: Toufik san told sensei he is
being puzzaled by thinking about his probelm why, and he
can not overcome from his situation. Then sensei asked him
to briefly disscussed about his difficulties that will be also
help to understand the M1 student.
Then sensei asked him to write the issuses in his
research note and explain how he is trying to overcome
this situation.
And then he told that he read books daily and
take classed and he also tried to read kanji.

We need to atleast remember the time when we stuck
to like this kind of similar situation.
Some professor are trying to find automatically with the help
of AI and wearable devices this kind of situation.
Sensei suggested to record some time in research and code
things and can be tracked down how much time we
have invested in research and other thoughts. Its a very
a rare skill and we are doing masters for overcome
the feelings. And strongly suggested to avoid personal strong feeling.
And for next time sensei expected to see some time
management prove like how much time has been used for
reading japanese , and magazine and also the research.
Next time sensei would ask him how many time in
his research and japanease.

About last last meeting:

Sensei asked toufik san about the new finding from the
others note, and suggested him to highlight some notes that
whould be efficient for understanding what was his last disscussion.
And he successfully he started thinking how he could reach
next step not what would be the next step.

From Takahashi san:
fight against our natural feelings.

Try enjoying Japanese written magazine.
You have so many way to learn Japanese and important
skills for your feature.

(Go more detailed discussion about our research)

We confirmed: facts "you did not spend enough time to
write code for these weeks"

Proper responsible position in company. Have to right answer to
difficult question.
Some more money. If you not want to easy and
easy spending those money to ... is OK.
Somewhat unfortune for us is to make good answer to
very difficult question to be answered.
Get into these situation easily.
むずかしい
You have to have those skills to fight against our
natural feelings.

## 19.12.24

In last meeting sensei told that we would not have
lab meeting in next week and next next week. Then
our next lab meeting would be in next year 8th
of january.
About my research i have make one prototype version 5
for one specific situation like a AV is seeing the
Stop sign and just crush the stop sign and go
through, this would a error but sensei also suggested to
make this kind of error also.

## 20.12.24

明けましておめでとうございます。(Akemashite omedetou gozaimasu.)
In this vacation i am trying to learn japanease and
improve my daily routine and also my food habit.

## 6.1.25

I updated the last prototype with limited situation, may be
it could be the initial for the further update of
my code. In last update the output was like AV
have seen the S and Stop.

H = Human Car,
AV = Autonomous Vechiels,
S = Stop Sign

## 7.1.25

In the last lab meeting, i got some comment from
sensei,

- what happen in our mind when we think its
very simple to be done, we dont do the simple
way,
rather we think more difficult thing and when started work
we couldnt complete, we fail.
- Sensei suggested some efficient way to learn japanease like
discuss with other japanease lab members.
- Use AI for personal assistant to learn japanease
- For japnease learning to make some note and try
to speak it. Live conversation is most difficult, and most
easiest way is to make memo what you want to
say and say it again and again.
About the Research,
Sensei suggested to make some simple text base prototype for
the LLM.
I have already some prepared text-representation of simulation environment
then i paste text representation onto chat box of GPT-4o
and ask him to whether he can understand it or
not.
Then, LLM gave so complicated answer far from expectation. add
to prompt this "just answer STOP or FORWARD". After updating
prompt, LLM answered "STOP".


## 8.1.25 **LAB Meeting Disscussion with me**:

Local learning LLM,

**Note from Tauhid San**
Memebers present in the meeting: rafi-san, toufiq-san, fahmidul-san, rubel-san, misho-san,
touhid-san, mizutani-san,Takahashi-san
Today's lab meeting started at 1:06 pm.
Sensei greeted us Happy New Year. He also awared us
about the traffic rules.
Discussion with Rafi san. Rafi san told about the last
meetings follow up. Rafi san made two prototypes for two
situations. Rafi san described his protypes and he also demonstrated
them. sensei asked him about the current issues he is
facing. Rafi san told about the issues he is facing.
Sensei gave him some suggestions to solve the issues. Sensei
told him about different situations and told him we don't
need to reimpliment the existing code. Using deep learning it
can be done. Sensei also told him about the different
libraries and tools that can be used. Sensei also told
him see existing code and watch tutorials. Mid term presentation
in the end of March. We must plan about the
monthly planning. How LLMs' handles the situation. Without proper planning
It is hard to implement. Sensei asked him to focus
on learning Japanese. Japanese is really very very important. ENjoy
movies with japanese student to get more new insights of
japanese language. So that he can fully understand the Japanese
language. Next week we will have a company in th
campus so we can attend the meeting. Sensei asked him
to apply in some small companies to increase the chance
of employment.


## 9.1.25

I have to make a simulation that can be a
input for the LLM, Now what can i do i
can check suma sans research documents for getting some idea.

## 10.1.25

Today is friday, after completing my prayer i came to
room. Started thinking about how can be the simulation can
be updated. I have some neck pain, i checked the
pressure and its high.

## 13.1.25

I am so much tired for last two days i
have done arubatio for like 18 hours, i am feeling
not to do anything today.

## 14.1.25

I have try to create prototype and there were some
error and now i am trying to solve those error.
Maybe next week i gonna show some output.

## 15.1.25 **LAB MEETING**

We will have some disscussion with M2 and Mizutani san.
And sensei suggested to M1 students to prepare theri research
paper from the conclusion.

Disscussion with Toufik san: Started with some ordinary question, what
we disscussed last time and what are the current issue
he is facing now.
Toufik san searching some research paper and he can not
finding some good papers, Then sesnei asked why are you
searching some paper.

Then sensei asked why you souldnt search for some related
papers? As far i remember searching some paper their ambition
was high and they did the work as they described
in the paper , if we read or use this
paper our planing wouldnt match our height. Our target will
be lower and our work would be more less, thats
why we shouldnt search some paper.
There are so many non research papers that are not
reviewed in proper way in the archive it easy to
upload such paper those are not actually research paper.

And research is not some following existing work rather its
a orginal work.

Then sensei asked him to explain why we shouldnt see
some related papers.

Whitout knowing our work what we have achived we cant
find some related paper, it would make some problem. Most
of the time it ends with picking some wrong paper.

Why we think complex simulation is more related to reality.
In our deep mind we think this step is very
easy i shold try more complex and i cant complete
the complex the portion and step into a neverending loop.
In the end i do nothing.

Then sensei wanted to see some current situtaion of touhid
san simulation and asked how did he setup the trashhold
value.
It is best to set up the parameter. His current
assumption is to set up the parameter is best for
now.
--------
Then sensei talked about job hunting and about how is
he preparing for having language exllecence.

## 16.01.25

Next i can do check wheather the simulation is working
properly for LLM or not and then the LLM is
proving what kind of output.

## 17.01.25

I tried to collect some comment from LLM for different
situation and in think working as expected,
![Stop before sudden break of AV1](/mywork/outfromLLM/LLMOutput05.31 PM.png)
![Stop if see a ball](/mywork/outfromLLM/LLMOutput05.49 PM.png)

## 20.01.25

I am not feeling well today.

## 21.01.25

Summarization of last lab meeting,
I showed my updated version of simulation, and then sensei
asked about my current issues, that time i was confused
with the issued and in current situation LLM are giving
output only stop or forward what would be next. then
sensei suggested some point, like we will keep out simulation
or expected output simple like in different kind of situations
promt would be answer like Is it go Forward or
Stop. And also talked about my current situation of job
hunting and japanese learning. And suggested to join some company
briefing and watch anime for learning japanease.

## 22.01.25 **Lab Meeting,DM**

Current Issues,
![Limited number of query can be done in Chatgpt](/mywork/outfromLLM/LLMOutput01.png)

**fukuta: 22:35

Now I have prepared an experimental setup of lm-studio remote
desktop environment which can be accessed from the lab network.
You can access to this "shared desktop" using VNC by
the following steps:
Connect to my (=supervisors) wifi network (Fukuta-BB5 or Fukuta-BB5WPA).
use "192.168.11.120:7" to access VNC remote desktop. The pass is
which you are using to access to lab's WiFi. (please
don't write it in slack channel if you don't know
it, but try telling it using the whiteboard at the
lab room.)
You will see the screen of LM studio. Here, you
can even use some of 70B-scale LLMs in a "usable"
speed(>1tok/sec).
Note: This is an experimental testing setup. Sometimes it may
be shutdown suddenly due to maintenance reason. This is a
shared remote desktop so everyone will share the same screen.
Be careful someone is also seeing this screen, or some
may accidentally delete your important logs.
PLEASE: DO NOT CONNECT TO MY WIFI UNLESS YOU ARE
USING THE ABOVE REMOTE DESKTOP!! Connecting to your lab room
network for ordinary tasks! When you finished using it, please
disconnect from the above-mentioned WiFi. Please do NOT setup auto-connect-to-this-WiFi!
(Fukuta-BB3a should be much faster in many case :wink:
If you don't know what is VNC, see the following
(but not ask it to me!)
https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/macos/
You can download realVNC viewer from the above link.
Then use the address specified in step 2. to connect
to the remote desktop.
Again, please don't ask me about your own personal network
troubles! If you cannot manage them by your own, then
you are not eligible to use it.
<<<LIMITATIONS>>>
Due to the university's regulation, we cannot give you a
direct access to the above from other networks. Sorry please
come to the lab room 1 and then play with
it.
The remote desktop is only for lm-studio. You cannot run
any other code on there.
If you are going to use Local Inference Server, do
NOT use the default port number "1234". I have already
changed the server port to "12534". Please use this as
is, to avoid unnecessary port number conflicts.
Due to the limitation of VNC protocol itself, we cannot
do copy and paste in Japanese and other 8-bit characters
in texts. Soon Japanese Input to the chat window will
be available (I have already found the way to do
but not enough time to apply it to the current
setup!). But this copy-paste issue in 8-bit characters cannot be
resolved in any way, unfortunately.

**Note from Mishu:** Sensei discussed
Fast off, Sensei informed us to write our research note
in LATEX. Then Sensei discussed with Rafi san. Rafi san
fast told sensei last time what kind of discussed with
him. Then Sensei asked him what kinds of issues he
faces right now. He told Sensei which kinds of issues
he faces right now. Sensei gave some suggestions. Now, Rafi
san is practicing with Mizutani san about AI in Japanese.
Sensei informed us to be careful about using AI to
hunt data. Sensei, for a long time, discussed with Rafi
san and Mizutani san LLM RealVNC viewer. Rafi san asked
Mizutani san how to connect LLM to his personal computer.
Now Mezutani san connects LLM Rafi san's computer. sensei told
us that sharing some knowledge in the lab is very
important.LLM problem solved now Rafi San is back in the
discussion. Rafi San successfully used the RealVNC viewer. Sensei reminds
us not to depend on our minds. The discussion finished
with Rafi san.
Now Sensei sort of discussed with Mizutani san with Japanese.
一言 入れると一応 論理的には問題ないと入れるように 修士論文を書こうとするとからとっても 読みづらいものになってしまうことはあって必要なことが書かれた部分を毎回探さないといけなくなるので なので 書いてある内容に多少の重複 などはあっても書いてある内容の細かさに違いがあるのであれば それはそれであの残しても大丈夫な場合が結構ありますよ はいなるんでしょうね
One word: If you include it, it's logically fine, but
when you try to write a master's thesis, it can
become very difficult to read, and you have to look
for the part that says what you need every time.
So, even if there is some overlap in what is
written, if there are differences in the details of what
is written, there are many cases where it's okay to
leave it in. Yes, I guess that's the case.
直さなきゃいけなくなって困ってます
I have to fix it and I'm in trouble.
so probably the doctor process of writing up your own
Fitness Maybe some for different world what other Japanese Master
costume to us three doing but at least they share
some common ideas on there so knowing about how he's
writing his cases comfort useful to you I hope hi
are you

来年のこの時期に変わらなくてすみますよ いろんな意味で まず大事なのは ですね はい
So that it won't have to change at this time
next year. In many ways, the first thing that's important
is, right?
ところで色々 設定して実際 文字を使ったおもしろから 文字の大きさを戻すの忘れて小さくなったりしません か大丈夫そうなら いいですけれど はいだんだん 年齢が上がってきて 老眼 という
困ったものを抱えている先生が選ばれて本当の設定がうまくできてないと本当か適当に近いサイズのポンプをするので困るんだけど そういうのところ
By the way, it's fun to set various things and
actually use letters, so don't forget to change the size
of the letters and make them smaller? If it seems
okay, that's fine, but as I get older, I'm getting
older and I have a problem with presbyopia, so if
the settings are not done properly, I'll use a pump
that's close to the actual size, which is a problem.


**Note from Tauhid san:**
**Memebers present in the meeting:** rafi-san, toufiq-san, fahmidul-san, rubel-san, misho-san,
touhid-san, mizutani-san,Takahashi-san<br>
**Today's lab meeting started at 1:06 pm.**
Sensei discussion with Rafi san
Rafi san showed his cloud LLM results and told his
issues about the limitations of the cloud based LLMs and
showed his results of perplexity GPT. Sensei suggested Rafi san
to check other kind of cloud based LLMs. Sensei awaredus
about the pronmts we are using in the GPTs and
they can use them in the future for training. Rafi
san asked Mizutani san to learn more about Local LLMs
and mizutani showed him some models and the results were
consisted and pick aya model. Now sensei asked rafi san
about other issues. Rafi san asked mizutani san that how
can he connnect to the shared pc from his personal
computer and mizutani san showed him so. Now Rafi san
can access to local LLM and he can continue his
research without any limitations which he faced in cloud based
LLMs. Then sensei asked him about his next issues. Sensei
also added that he will have his mid term presentation
in march and about submiting his research paper to any
international conference. Writing research paper can clear up some ideas
about the research. We should not follow the deep feeling
blindly. We must start writing and summaring to research. Then
next discussion will be with mizutani san. We need to
show our research notes in the next lab using **LaTeX**.
We must be careful about using the Optical drive.
Today I learned about VNC, Virtual Machine, Cloud LLMs, Local
LLMs,
良いと思いますので。 あらあら。 2023 見つかりましたか はい。 修士論文を準備している時には、必要なファイルはすぐに参照できるように。 準備をしておいた方がいいですよ。 そしてサンプルを見るときは1人の先輩のものだけを見るのではなく複数人のものを見るようにした方がいいですよ あの先輩だけが。 見ることができますか？

専門分野の軽い知識がないと非常に複雑です。

**Note from Azi san:**
Discussion with Rafi
The discussion started with the usual question: "What did we
discuss last time, and what issues is Rafi facing now?"
Rafi began by answering the first question, mentioning that Sensei
suggested watching anime for language development and talked about job
hunting. Then, he switched to the second question.
Rafi showed some AI services he is using, including Perplexity,
Gemini, and Claude.
Sensei talked about data safety and protection when sharing with
AI.
Mizutani-san connected to a local LLM machine deployed in Sensei's
room and ran Rafi's prompt. It provided the same result
as Claude and Perplexity.
Sensei emphasized the importance of sharing knowledge and encouraged us
never to hesitate to ask questions if we don't know
something. Mizutani-san is helping Rafi deploy VNC on his laptop
so that he can access the machine in Sensei's room.
Sensei stressed the importance of staying in the lab and
meeting people in person, which is why we are here
instead of in our home country or dormitory room, or
attending online. It's a great opportunity.

**Note from Fahmidul san:**

**Note from Toufik san:**



## 23.01.25
I am planning to take some more result from the
local LLM, Then in next issue could be how to
compare the result as human perspective.

## 24.01.25
I am not feeling so well.

## 27.01.25

About my curretn
- We must start writing and summaring to research.

## 28.01.25 **Lab Meeting**

Next month the schedule would be some changes, In next
meeting would be skipped. In next next wednesday we may
have this meeting may be delayed, In 19 February,maybe there
will be our meeting, Again 26th the meeting would be
skipped. Sensei will let us know in later moment or
in slack.

Why we disscuss about combination parameter because from currrent code
we get a single
why we were disscussion to overcome the confusion, and get
some work to be done like his confusion is changing
random parameter or checking each result is difficult. Sensei telling
about 10thousand output or parameter.
Still toufik feel deep pressure, Deciding the right parameter will
be used in the code.
Why this disscussion to overcome the confusion of deciding the
right parameter,

Sensei asked toufiq san about the last lab discussion -
some important points from the code, why he gave the
fixed value for threshold, why he put some parameters, and
gave suggestions to put some parameter distribution. Sensei asked us
th same to us about the last meeting.

Sensei told him not to worry about the parameters but
try them all. Current situation in simulation is to try
all possible parameters. Finite number of combination of patrameter values.
Every moment he has to change the parameters to find
the exact parameters.
Why he did not update his code to handle dynamic
parameters? Its not complicated but hard to try all the
parameters.
We must listen to the discussions very carefully and take
notes. Deep feelings can distruct us by looking into thousands
of outputs from the parameters, but this is the right
way to do so, one fixed parameter is not enough
to get the right output. he can add different parameters
in different scenarios like discount. He don't need to change
all the parameters in the scenarios which is better for
the users.
Sometimes our deep mind can produce doubts and we believe
it blindly. Which can be happen to us in near
future. Sensei told that there is no 'why' in the
toufiq sans note.
We are doing so because to find the correct parameters,
without trying all the possible parameters we can't decide the
right one to use.
What was the issues? why this discussions - to decide
the right parameters. This is the logical structure. We should
be careful about some deep felling like 'we should decide'.
When we try all the combination of parameters then we
don't need to decide.

In summary we did fight against our deep mind ,
and try to understand ...
Maybe toufik san understand what happened in todays disscussion.
todays focus was **WHY** and ..
Written code is really simple but dynamic code would be
hard.


## 29.01.25
For now the main issue i am facing is continiously
applying for companies and getting negative feedback from them for
not havig japanease proficiency.

## 30.01.25
About the research what should i do next, right now
i have access to the local LLM and Cloud base
as far my simulation the results are satysfying. What can
i do next?

## 03.02.25
There was another problem i mentioned that lack of cordination
of vechiels. what can be done for this problem would
be my issue.

## 04.02.25


About my research there are upcoming mid term presentation in
the last week of march. I have to ger prepared
for the presentation.

## 05.02.25

I got some information that the upcoming IIAI conferance dates,
the paper submission dates are 15 of april.
So in very recent i have three works
- making presenatation for the midterm
- updating the paper for conference
- and Adding some complex scenarios

## 06.02.25
## 07.02.25

## 10.02.25

Our thesis midterm presentation date is announced, hmaster's thesis proposal/interim
presentation on March,Date: Thursday, March 27 and Friday, March 28.
Place: Faculty of Informatics Bldg. 2

About research paper writing i have to clarify the problem
statement and what things we are considering. Like in simulation
we are giving simple textbase input.



## 11.02.25

Today i have and internship in Kosai, I left in
the morning it was basically a one day work experience.
Though it is close to hamamatsu, this the first time
for me travelling alone. And fortunately i didnt face any
hazard. It was a good experience.
I am so much tired today. Tomorrow may be there
will be lab meeting.

## 12.02.25 **Lab Meeting**

**Last meeting summarization:**
- Cloud LLM has some limitation like less number of
query?
for this i asked mizutani san for some free cloud
base LLM, he shows me the Deepsekk and we checked
one of my sample simulation and the output was as
expected. Then we disscussed about there would be some limitation
for cloud base LLM.
- How to incorporate/use local LLM?
For this again i asked mizutani san how to use
local LLM, first he showes me how to use then
we coonect my pc to lm-studio remote desktop environment.

Some upcomming schedule: master's thesis proposal/interim presentation on March,Date: Thursday,
March 27 and Friday, March 28. My current situation is
there are many deadlines are coming and as sensei's schedule
maybe we will have very limited number of meeting. What
can we do for taking proper preparation?

And i applied for internship though i am not sure
wheather i will get the chance or not, but if
i have chance then the intership schedule is proablly 3/14
- 3/26.

In my research there was an another portion that is
communication between the Vehicle, i am confused this portion what
can we for this part for now?


## 13.02.25

Sensei told that in february 19 there will be meeting
and next next meeting will be skiped and
then 5th of march that meeting will also be skiped.
and 12 of march the campus will be closed beacuse
there would be enterance exam.
Then we will have possible 2 meetings before our mid
term presentation.

## 17.02.25

In monday i had helth checkup and it seems my
pressure is not normal and they a lot of blood
and i am not feeling ok, I took the day
off.

## 18.02.25

I am taking preparatin for tomorrows interview and getting tensed
about upcoming schedule.
About my research

## 19.02.25 **Lab Meeting DM:**

**Last meeting summarization:**

i have chance then the intership schedule is proablly 3/14
- 3/26.

- In my research there was an another portion that
is communication between the Vehicle, i am confused this portion
what can we for this part for now?

i think to do this , a car will have
a certatin communication base radius, like in this certain distance
it can communicate with other crossing cars and share it
next move and so on. this can minimize the accident
possiblity. issue is i dont know how to do this.
Ask LLM about this situation hey llm think you are
in this kind of situation what would you do.
** We assume the car have light communaction setup and
they can communicate each other
** Then next issue would be how the LLM react
with the communication.
Simulation where the cars can communicate each other !

We have to setup some specific situation, Like road crossing
situation two cars is communication each other and sending message
and in the promt and How LLM is reacting.

For genaral implementation is little tough rather i can do
it for some specifiq situation and for communication in initial
i can only use 0/1 for only stop and forward
command and later moment it could be extended.
And if i got stuck to how can i do
it, first i may have the clear idea what i
want to do.

- What i can do about the presentatin slide what
can be added in there.


Midterm presentation : presentation tittle,
Toward a Multi-Agent Approach for Dynamic **Traffic Control and Optimization,**
what is missing in this tittle-

Toward a Multi agent approch for Dynamic LLM Accident Car
control Car communication

Toward a Multi agent approch for LLM-Based Dynamic Vehicle control
and communication in accidental condition.


Like we also incorporiting LLM in our research, and its
about safe driving contribution to Autonomous Level5,
We are going to check How LLM is going to
perform in Unknow unsafe situations compare to current AVS.
We also want to have communication between the cars that
could be human drive car or AV.V2V using multiagent.
maybe slightly different from dynamic traffic control and optimization i
think.maybe i am wrong.
Avoiding accident is also may contribution to traffic cntrol or
optimization. - not the full problem solution. Its maybe the
part of big goal,
It also reflect the doing on my research.

Same thing would be done in toufik sans updating the
presentation tittle:


**Note from touhid san**
Rafi san told about the last meetings issues LLMs and
DeepSeek AI. He successfully implemented the LLM in his local
machine. Then he talked about the M2 mideterm presententation and
he discussed about the difficulties about tight schedule. He asked
about the midterm presentation slides. Sensei told him about the
presentation registration - presentation title, Rafi san is confused about
his research title as the existing title doesn't covers all
the research scopes. So sensei asked him what is missing
in the title. Rafi san replied incorporating LLm in research,
Safe driving contribution to Autonomous Level5, avoiding accidents. We may
set up great goal and our research may impact very
less. The present title covers a lot of things so
sensei asked him to revise the title based on the
topics covered. Rafi san hardly explained in his research note
about the issue of his research title. So all these
should be included in the research notes. **To write the
title we should tfind the keyword of our research and
it should cover impotant topics of our research.** Then sensei
asked him about the present issues about his research and
rafi san said that he is confused about the communication
part of the research. Then sensei asked rafi san to
assume some situations so that he can solve the current
issue like the simulation where the cars can communicate with
each other.
Sensei discussion with Toufiq San
Sensei asked toufiq san about his presentation title and is
it okay? explain. Sensei asked him to analyse the title
and find any missing part. Sensei asked him about the
title that is he going to control the whole ecommerce
in the market but which is not okay and sensei
asked him about which part should e update. The toufiq
san idendified the missing parts with the help of sensei
and sensei asked if he can update by himself as
he has seen the process of Rafi san. Then sensei
also helped toufiq san to write his presentation title. We
can also do the same in thinking about writing our
own research title. Noticing the method is very important because
without sensei's help we have to do it ourselves.

## 20.2.25


The last summerization is i have to upadate my paper
and then form there i can upadate my presentation slide
also. And for other part i think i will just
include the idea.

## 21.2.25

I tried to explain my research to the M1 students
and get comment from them. And i got also get
some tentative comment from takahashi san also.

## 24.2.25

I have two main focus about research i have midterm
presentation in end of this month and An internation conference
in middle is April.
Sensei suggested me to update my paper.

## 25.2.25

I am taking preparatin for tomorrows interview and getting tensed
about upcoming schedule.
About my research.

## 26.2.25


This is my isse,
i think to do this , a car will have
a certatin communication base radius, like in this certain distance
it can communicate with other crossing cars and share it
next move and so on. this can minimize the accident
possiblity. issue is i dont know how to do this.



## 27.2.25
**ABout V2V communication**
We have to setup some specific situation, Like road crossing
situation two cars is communication each other and sending message
and in the promt and How LLM is reacting.
For genaral implementation is little tough rather i can do
it for some specifiq situation and for communication in initial
i can only use 0/1 for only stop and forward
command and later moment it could be extended. And if
i got stuck to how can i do it, first
i may have the clear idea what i want to
do.


## 28.2.25

In my research there was an another portion that is
communication between the Vehicle i got some suggestion about this
from sensei.
Ask LLM about this situation hey llm think you are
in this kind of situation what would you do.
- We assume the car have light communaction setup and
they can communicate each other
- Then next issue would be how the LLM react
with the communication.
Simulation where the cars can communicate each other !

## 3.3.25

From the march 1st the all company have started their
recuritment. And this week going to be an haptic.

## 4.3.25

I have disscussed with shirai sensei about school recommendation, he
told me that i didnt fullfill the requirement of getting
the reocmmendation. I am felling nervous and low because i
have really limited japanese language proficiency.

## 5.3.25

I have two job inoformation session and About research i
think
i have to add details about the dirving domain situation.

## 6.3.25

I have a interview today at koito, that will be
in japanease and i am practicing for this.

## 7.3.25

For last week i just attend various company information session
and all are happend in japanese, it was a great
experience. For research i have updated some portion. Still there
are many things i have to add.


## 10.3.25

In last disscussion with me, i have shared some upcoming
schedule about midterm presentation and conference and told sensei that
i am concern and confused about the short time we
will have for practice.
I was confused about my research title as the existing
title doesn't covers all the research scopes. So sensei asked
me what is missing in the title.Then we chaged the
tittle and the present title covers a lot of topics
covered. For now its ok. I got another suggestion from
sensei that i should started writing the research paper. Then
i can also update the Presentation slide.

I have started update the paper and next meeting i
gonna share updated paper.

## 11.03.25 **Lab Meeting:**

Next meeting will be ordinary but the time can change.
For next month we may have disscussion about tentative schedule
about M1 students class. Next 26 will held as usal.
And then 2nd april we will skip the meeting.
Second week of april this week we will skip our
metting. During this two week properly use slack channel.

Disscussion with taufik san, He have make some data and
create some figure and then sensei asked him what is
the purpose creating this figure. And its give hard time
to toufik san.

Sensei is telling that some company is creating real time
data as a researcher we actually we dont need use
real data. And if you only show some data and
figure without having the understanding what gonna do with that,
this could be somewhat troublesome for you, the commenter of
conference or reader can complain about it.
After writing the note sensei told him to think about
his research purpose. We gonna tink about your research question
that will say it in the conclusion part of your
paper.
**Note form toufik i missed this part**

Genaration of data and comparing is not the purpose of
research rather it is way of showing someting,
We can implement a simulation to terge to shown for
the system using necessary parameters for this assumption.

Then sensei asked what is the purpose of your research?
The action will not be the purpose, LIke you are
saying to implement?
To implement to show what?
We have some purpose to implement something then tell me
what is the purpost of yours.

Then toufik replied his simulation,
can agent base simulation data cober various aspect of customers
behaviour and promotional factors.
Then he wrote i am not sure about my research
purpose.

*****-----

today meeting is in onlile. Sensei told about schedule specially
for Masters second grade
- why is we are doing this code and data?
- generating of data or comparing data is not perpose
of research rather it is way of showing somethings.
- some researcher working with real data bz they want
to show how is act with real data in merket.
- we can implement a simulation to terger to shown
for the system using necessary parameters for this assumption.
can agent base simulation data cover various aspect of Customers's
behavior and promotional factors. i'm not sure about purpose of
reseach is above line or not. I am worried about
can simulation data cover all aspect of customer behaviors.
what can we do::
- we can fixed some aspet of customer's behaviors.
- what happen when his desire product price will get
by discout.
- if discount is less than his buying capacity what
decision he takes, what a customer choose when quality and


Disscussion with me ,






## 12.03.25

Now lets introduce the output from different LLM and disscuss
about the input and also i gonna disscuss about the
assumption. in my paper.

## 13.03.25

I make a folder at the Overleaf to upload my
least output from different LLM. Then tried updated the methodology
part.

## 14.03.25

For last week i just attend various company information session
and all are happend in japanese, it was a great
experience. For research i have updated some portion. Still there
are many things i have to add.

## 17.03.25

Previously i searched hugging face once and choose the option
text to text, and it suggested many Cloud base LLM
and it is categorized in different perspective like top download,
top used. For instance i used only googles LLM and
Added the output in the paper.

I have uploaded the update paper and waiting for sensei's
comment.

## 18.03.25

In last disscussion with me, i have shared some upcoming
schedule about midterm presentation and conference and told sensei that
i am concern and confused about the short time we
will have for practice.

I was confused about my research title as the existing
title doesn't covers all the research scopes. So sensei asked
me what is missing in the title.Then we chaged the
tittle and the present title covers a lot of topics
covered. For now its ok. I got another suggestion from
sensei that i should started writing the research paper. Then
i can also update the Presentation slide.



## 19.03.25 **Lab Meeting DM:**


I got some comment from sensei,

What kind of models and changes in promt , what
whould be the difference and GPU performance can change the
performance

Sub research question,
What can you see from the results? Is it enough
to test them just once? Can we test them for
20 times or so to calculate some statistics such as
the mean and variance of them?

This research question is too general to be answered. Break
this into more specific sub research questions, such as, "Is
an agent able to decide the action to take by
having a help from LLM on without having specific learning
process on the situation?"

If we change the promt a bit is going to
effect the decision of the LLM?
Is it comptible to use Only the Cloud base LLM?
How the GPU performance will effect the time of decision
making?
Did The all LLM giving same result ?

What is changing their decision?
Language / addition promt engineering/

what factor you have consider to chosing the LLM? -
what should be explained by catagory -
top downloaded? - most recent / most trending / recommended
/?
Have to be specified when it was it top downloaded
like top downloaded in 19th march.

What other language dependency?
how the different language may affect the output?

catagory:
- Quantization, what qunatization is used, metrics
I have to find some reference to know more about
quantization.
lamma cpp
- Model size
-

What kind of computer we used?
cpu/gpu

Promt changing result - recording the changes.

We should record what we did is important thing in
our research.
If we dont take detailed note it may hamper recording
the what we did, its also necessary to prove what
we tried to learn during the time.

Add timeline to the presentation. After updating the paper i
may have chance to update the slides.

**Note from Takahashi san:**
don't hesitate to be deleted by sensei.
You may not reach latter part on plan presentation. actually
we are doing is very important but difficult, necessary important
all of you
early as possible you may spend mostly 1 year.

In last last meeting, we discussed about research title etc.
You are worrying about time is short.
Most of students are thinking same thing.
Actually you are doing things very slowly.
Wide-spreading lower performance doing everything slowly.
We can take practice to fight against such a situation;
you have responsible to do some very important things at
your company(tightly connected to your future, right?).
Then we gonna clarlify your issue by seeing removing them
into here, doesn't mean your writing is wrong.

You can do things more easily. Just pushing of regenerate
button again and again.
Sometimes we cannot notice such a easy task, when we
are focusing on "is this OK is this OK?" Therefore
noticing such feelings is very important.
Then please start writing I'll give you small moment to
write down your thoughts.
When you are thinking something, try to write them down
on your note as well.

Sometimes you might catch more general research question, last one
is very general one. You can ... some detailed one.

Todays topdown LLM .... And also another criteria... clarification is
very important "when you see top download at a time
19th march".
Recent changes are changing day by day.
To keep the reproducibility quantization they utilizes some matrix a
very important.
Uploaded model says q10 showing us some parameters on doing
this quantization but don't provide the detailed way of quantization.
Removing sparse part (simle-zero or something).
Do you know something detailed explanation about quantization?
You wrote "What does quantization size mean"?
llama.cpp is nice because it shows good performance even on
CPUs including Intel or AMD.
Saying the method of quantization is neccesarry. reproducibility is very
important, but you are not doing it.
Which quantization is better which languages you use, native language
you are speaking also nice.
How those result is language dependent or not is further
research.
Japanese language too match quantized some other language for some
words korean language, these happens... Japanese is very difficult
Japense specifically tuned LLM sometimes further optimization keep performance compared
to other languages.
I cannot use ...some european people.

Visiting toyokawa toyohashi city, things dramatically change. their driving speed
is so different.
Respecting local customs.

Doing things in parallel is very important. → Take right
strategy.

Specially designed CPUs including vector processing unit.
Exactly the same model and same parameters result was very
different.

Actual core contribution to the community is ... our natural
expectation.

Go back to first situation, how do we prepare some
nice slides? Uhh.

Disscussion with toufik san:

toufiq san has joined in his internship and sensei asked
him about the internship and he told that it is
very good but at this time it is very difficult
for him to concentrate in all the things because he
hase many things to focus on. Then toufiq san talked
about his internship - the company is very strict in
terms of time management and quality work. the company is
located near the beach of hamamatsu. two days he travelled
by bus but today he rode bicycle as he had
to join the lab meeting. he had to speak in
Nihongo in the company. which is excellent. so sensei asked
him to demonstrate some japanese language. so he demonstrated that
how he told about his meeting and leaving early today.
he also added that though he is doing internship but
they are treated as a permanent worker. sensei told that
in some japanese companies it is very important in the
selection process. In the internship is the chance to learn
about the work culture about the company. sensei asked all
the passing students to burn all the research data in
the DVD's. which is much more reliable way of storing
then using cloud based storage. After joining in any internship
we should think about how we can contribute in the
company the experience will help us to choose the next
internship and company. all companies are not good in Japan
as like any other country so we should be very
careful and we can ask about the company to some
people who has working experience in the company. sensei asked
hassan san about the last meeting discussion. so he told
about the last discussion but some points were missing so
senseia asked about us to tell about the missing points.
we also take the memos of others note in our
research notes so we don't miss any details of the
lab meeting discussion. When we are doing some complicated things
only our own mind thoughts are very risky so we
should take comments from others so that we are in
the right track. because remembering is very hard. hassan san
again told about his last meeting discussion after reading everyones
research notes. sensei told that it is very important for
us to remember the important points and helpful to find
the missing points in own research notes. so we must
not hesitate to share our notes with each other. toufiq
san asks about the updated code. Sensei asked hassan san
about the current issues and he told about the comparison
part in the he should include in the paper. so
sensei asked him to write those issues in the research
note and also suggested us to write anything we are
facing issues in the research notes. hassan san asked sensei
aout the inclusion of the statistical data in his paper
to compare the result. we should be clear about our
goal to start coding.

Research question of toufik san, can we make some simulation


## 20.03.25

what is quantization : basic meaning is rounding off. like
1.8999 = 1.9 less bit save space.

In the context of LLM : Input set of large
value -> reducing precision of weight value -> less the
output set -> rounding off
- less storage
- faster functional
trade off
- quantizing model can reduce the accuracy
-

## 21.03.25


## 22.03.25

One missing link writing
- i havent mention about the other communication part of
V2V what consideration we will kepp in mind and what
kind of experiment we will conduct.
- Sensei once suggest about we dont have to bother
about the communication part we will assume that some others
already have achived that now one car is communicating his
cueernt status when it run into anothers cars a certain
radius lets say 10 meter radius of a car to
avoid any unwanted situation , whenever it encounter it will
share its current status like what are around him and
its speed if any potential decision it can take like
there is some stop sign for partial road construction it
will stop after 20 meter. like this . this communication
will happen between the cars and let know the decision
agent also.
Here the question arise is one agent is enough for
taking all decision. here comes the idea of multi agent.


## 24.03.25

Anothere research question can be added,
A single LLM base decision agent is enough for take
decison?

## 25.03.25

What now, chossing LLM and what would be the factor
.
first i am chossing LLM model family through Quantization ,
what others can be considered
then what factor can be considered to picking the model
for text to text human like reasoning for autonomous vechiels.
- LM Studio Recommendations (Best Performance & Accuracy)
Mistral 7B – Strong instruction-following capabilities, optimized for reasoning (4-bit,
8-bit).
OpenHermes 2.5 – Open-source model, fine-tuned for instruction-following tasks (4-bit,
8-bit).
DeepSeek 7B – Competitive with GPT-4 in structured reasoning tasks
(4-bit, 8-bit).
- Hugging Face – Open Source Models (Top Downloads &
Performance)
LLaMA 2 13B – Reliable for reasoning, widely tested in
quantized formats (4-bit, 8-bit).
Mixtral 8x7B – High performance in reasoning tasks, supports long-context
understanding (4-bit, 8-bit).
- Top Commercial Services (Performance-Based Selection)
Claude 3 Sonnet – Consistent human-like reasoning, well-suited for AV
decision-making (Cloud-only).
GPT-4 Turbo – Advanced multi-step reasoning, but requires cloud-based deployment
(Cloud-only).
Falcon 7B/40B – Strong performance in reasoning tasks (8-bit, Cloud
for 40B, Local for 7B).
Justification for Selection Criteria

- Hugging Face Models: Chosen based on high downloads and
proven effectiveness in reasoning tasks. These models are widely used
and have been tested extensively within the research community.
- LM Studio Models: Selected for their strong performance and
compatibility with local deployment. These models offer efficient reasoning capabilities
and work well within LM Studio's runtime.
- Top Commercial Services: Included based on comparative performance with
open-source models. These models have demonstrated high accuracy in previous
benchmarks and evaluations.
Additionally, due to compatibility issues, some models from Hugging Face
were tested directly on the Hugging Face interface instead of
running them locally through LM Studio.
Then run the test,

## 26.3.25 **Lab Meeting DM:**

First clarify what we already know,
2nd step is,


## 27.3.25
Sensei suggested me to add some clarification about the multiagent
framework.
clarification about the contribution slide,
Remove some slides about that are coverd in the talk,
another suggestion was update the model with newer one,


In our research, we will assume that vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
has been achieved through a standardized networking protocol, such as
LAN-based direct communication or a low-latency wireless system. Under this
assumption, each vehicle can communicate with other vehicles within a
defined radius (e.g., 10 meters). When a vehicle enters another
vehicle's information-sharing radius, they exchange data regarding their current status,
such as, Obstacle detection, road signs, and traffic conditions,Speed, direction,
and future intended actions.
To evaluate the impact of V2V communication on autonomous decision-making,
we will investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) process and
utilize this information. Specifically, we will examine whether incorporating V2V-exchanged
data improves decision accuracy and enables AVs to make more
precise and context-aware choices.
While V2V communication facilitates information sharing, it also introduces a
critical question:
Is a single centralized decision-making agent sufficient for processing all
incoming V2V data and making autonomous driving decisions, or is
a multi-agent system required for improved efficiency and scalability?

This real-time data exchange enhances situational awareness and helps prevent
accidents by enabling vehicles to make informed decisions based on
shared environmental data.



**We are here to learn through session.**

Disscussion with Toufik san:
Try confirming wheather we
weather the simulation is learning or not?

In japan it is important to ask repetedly untill you
understand. it is bit difficult

tittle - changing tittle
Clarification about multiagent. and senarios.


## 28.3.25 **Midterm Presentation**
Toufiq san
Slide with 4 figures. Is this your results? Or previous
research result, How to obtain these results?
What is the software/Api name? What language? What package? What
library? Are these famous libraries or packages. What is the
goal of this research?

**Question to me:**
- How you will use the info of other car
agent? why multi agent?

- What will be the Sharing data process? How many
situations?
- Slide - 17, the status of vehicles and obstacles
and how the situations are fed. For
example the text based situation.
- The amount of the detalled situations? -In future work
is not clear, possible future question.
**how to handle this data - see some paper mentioning
about some related work**
Level of detatil issue, asking about my assumption, phisiblity of
Multi agent contribution. Assumption to justification.
- How would you achieve the obstacle detection?
- Make sure about the assumptions of your research.

**Short discussion with sensei:**
Don't say har or yes when you dont undestandig the
question. About the taufik san situations there was a question
answer gap as sensei mentioned.

Toward a Multi Agent Approach for LLM-based...
**Araya sensei**
Is agent a car? Agent means..what? Autonomous vehicle. How do
you use other information from other car?
communication we ca.., if your car your car they can
share information, in fixed text format... what is the obstacle
traffic density, to the decision agent.
Decision agent make decision by using reasoning ability of LLM
And that's why we choose LLM mimicking human reasoning (including
common sense).
For now actually, we created scenario 5 situations.
If we can create dataset, pre-trained model, we don't reasoning.
This kind of LLM for their ability actually.
Kitani sensei
k. slide17 You showed the status of each vehicle, how
do you ばーばらいず the situation to the text?
r. Some other AI do that.
k. In my opinion it could be very important, amount
of the detailed situation you showed obstacle pedestrians... ;
Sometimes pedestrians sometimes doesn't looks go across the road how
to handle such situation,
r. some third-party (traditional obstacle detection) already achieved / there
are some gaps, unknown unsafe uncertain we are actually trying
use reasoning ability human-like decision make.
k. I see. More detailed information gets more accurate result
make sure assumption on your result.
12:17
(after kawabata's presentation, professors talks with...)
Kitani sensei said "I had been in India until yesterday.
Many drivers on the road hit a horn( :loudspeaker: ).
So it seemed to be enough that focusing on front
and other cars behind you will covers others. It was
very different from Japan and interesting. (note: it may mean
there are many information other than vision in India) I
heard Honda's(Japanese car maker) engineer said that India's road situation
is so efficient because little accidents happen there even everyone
don't follow traffic rules.".
Fukuta sensei said "When I went to China, every time
I look at cross road, accidents happened. The situation are
really different country to country.". (edited)


**Haruhiro Takahashi**
Here is the feedback from our supervisor
---
Rafi
("I" = "Fukuta sensei")
Before getting into the details, I'd say one thing "don't
forget to gather information".
What was observed was that 2 questions by Araya sensei
and Kitani sensei were somehow overlapping.
Getting such kind of discussion is one of preferable situation
because at least the keypoints of your presentation were captured
by them. So nice!
Araya sensei asked you "Why multi-agent?".
This question gave you a chance to explain more about
multi-agent approach and you clearly explained it.
Rafi spent many time to explain about the approach with
single-agent that's why Araya sensei asked that question.
The assumption and what you really focus on in your
research were very clearly explained in your answer. That's good.
Araya sensei asked you "How many situations...?". It may be
the question about the coverage.
(Fukuta sensei said something important here, but I couldn't catch
it.) ... Possible next research question.
Kitani sensei asked you about clarification and the discussion got
into the details.
Q: "How do you convert information into LLM-readable form?".
Kitani sensei asked that because the topic itself is being
researched actively,
so you can cite some related work also in this
context.
Next question was about your assumption and feasibility.
The feasiblity will be asked too at the time of
final presentation as well as clarification.


## 07.04.25

I will not directly mentioned about the number of the
scenarios rather i will upload the images of the scenarios.
Then run the test .
compare the expected result and the actual result.
In conclusion part :

## 08.04.25

prepare (how many? put the number here!) - i will
haldle this another way.
Done for now .
( From the results, what we can see? Put your
observations and what were consistent to your intuition and what
were somewhat different from your expectation.)

( Did you prepare the golden (correct) answer for these
scenarios? If so, please clearly state it and also calculate
how was the accuracy of the responses comparing to the
golden answers?)

## 09.04.25

From the results, what we can see? Put your observations
and what were consistent to your intuition and what were
somewhat different from your expectation.
- i tried to explain my understanding and observation of
the result for the scenarios.
Did you prepare the golden (correct) answer for these scenarios?
If so, please clearly state it and also calculate how
was the accuracy of the responses comparing to the golden
answers?
- Preparin the golden answer , this part i didnt
understand, and the about the accuracy

## 10.04.25

We tested the basic scenario in phi-2 and in every
run it changes its response. and add some explanation.

## 14.04.25

I got some new comment from sensei like ,
Why don't you also include some results (LLM outputs) on
these communication agent secnarios?

Why don't you also include the consistency checking results on
these difference generative AIs?

## 15.04.25

## 16.04.25

I have an job interview and i have to go
fuji.

## 17.04.25

I have another job interview in KOITO

## 18.04.25

I got a job offer from JATCO.

## 21.04.25

About the research and sensei comment i am planning to
add a new schenario that need the communication agent role.
but how would be the promt update i dont know
yet.

## 22.04.25

I have an final interview in KOITO and i have
to go in shizuoka.

## 23.04.25
Last disscussion about my paper,

I got some new comment from sensei like ,
Why don't you also include some results (LLM outputs) on
these communication agent secnarios?

Why don't you also include the consistency checking results on
these difference generative AIs?

Current issue is how to write the promt.

Next schedule,
Tomorrow sensei is busy and next week sensei will send
some schedule for M2 completeing the masters course.

In next week,

In next next week, after national holidays that will be
used for tuesday class and we will skip that day.

Disscussion with toufik san:

About taking text directly from chatgpt is prohabite, and the
most important thing is not fulfilling the result the process
reach to the result what messure we take it is
important.

we need a single person to bank craupt like this
illegal activities,
then sensei asked toufik san why didn he faced the
senseis question rather he just the removed the portion. about
the part of genarative AI.


## 24.04.25

i am trying to update the communication agents incorporated schenario
following senseis comment. I am thinking to add a new
situtaion where this communication agents information will be used. and
another comment from sensei was added some consistency result.


## 25.04.25

This is the situation ,

AV2 = Autonomous Car- cant see the stop sign
AV1 = Autonomous Truck,
S = Stop Sign

AV1 S
- - - - - - - - - -
- - - -

--------------------------
Initial Position:
AV2 AV1 S
- - - - - - - - - -
- - - -

--------------------------
Position Right Before STOP:
AV2 AV1 S
- - - - - - - - - -
- - - -

--------------------------
Simulation ended.
What the AV2 on the above would do? Please just
answer STOP or FORWARD.

for this i run this promt in gpt 4-turbo 20
times and result was not excepted like it resulted forward.
then i added the communication agents information and then the
situation looks like this,

AV2 = Autonomous Car- cant see the stop sign
AV1 = Autonomous Truck,
S = Stop Sign

AV1 S
- - - - - - - - - -
- - - -

--------------------------
Initial Position:
AV2 AV1 S
- - - - - - - - - -
- - - -

--------------------------
Position Right Before STOP:
AV2 AV1 S
- - - - - - - - - -
- - - -

--------------------------

Information from communication agent:
AV2 Communication Agent: Sending Own Status ---
Vehicle 2 Status Details:
Vehicle ID: 2
Obstacle Presence: True
Obstacle Proximity: 14 meters
Traffic Density: light
Intended Action: Forward

AV2 Communication Agent: Receiving Status from AV1 ---
Received Status Details:
Vehicle ID: 001
Obstacle Presence: True
Obstacle Proximity: 5 meters
Traffic Density: light
Intended Action: stop

What the AV2 on the above would do? Please just
answer STOP or FORWARD.

and this time it we also run the same promt
20 time and each time it resulted same ,"stop" then
i calculated the consistancy and updated the paper.

## 28.04.25

I upload the updated version in the slack and waiting
for senseis comment.

## 29.04.25

Sensei said i can upload this version after checking the
typo error. and i cheacked and upadated the paper and
upload it to the slack and waiting for senseis comment.

Cameraready due: May 30, 2025 - the paper is ready
to be prited and added to the book
Its about final version of the paper. In our submission
we have deleted the authors name and in camera ready
we have to added this to the cameraready paper. And
in case we have to do some adjust in the
lenght of the paper. After the getting the acceptance result
we will have to do the rest.

Early Registration due: May 30, 2025

The tittle was for the midterm presentation and as well
as for the conference, "Toward a Multi Agent Approach for
LLM-Based Dynamic Vehicle Control and Communication in Accidental Condition"

Extra analysis on multi agent approch,
About the word LLM, that is ok.
Dynamic Vehicle control, - the opposite side is static control
sytem means the car will have some way static way
of responding, like some learning apporch stored in the car,
the car having some preprogrammed routine in the response of
the situation. the response is the static.
For dynamic respond something better in the preprogrammed situation, that
is actually included in our work.
When we use the LLMs for the every moment decision
the car should have this dynamic character.
In Accidental Condition : For this When we dont have
the internet connection is it can use dynamic decision using
the LLms . For this We have think of the
local LLms, -

In local LLms we have to check the the performance
in this kind of situation and also the use of
commnication agent. expand the result on Local LLms.

Communication: the meaning of this word in unclear, - the
statically response of the communication agent.
Ask LLM about some effective communication
"What kind of additional cautions the car should send the
following cars, (in the radius)?"
In some exceptional case can car send some emergency message
to say stop?

- this are the things i have to do to
keep the tittle.

- Also extend the use of Local LLMs,

the context window size. the longer context size , the
more memory.
the short promt case, the size of LLm 30B size
20GB in quantized size,

Actually what you are doing in your work is not
the perfect fit to the title.
Add multiple agent approach. Actually what you are doing
You are also doing dynamic communication ? No ← title

## 16.05.25
**Research note from Touhid san:** **Today's lab meeting started at
2:25 pm.**
Sensei told about his throat condition which is gettin better
and better.
Last last week discussion we had paper submission deadline for
confernece. The deadline was japan time which was very little
margin.
Last week wednesday was tuesday's routine.
In the conference 5 papers in total were submitted from
our LAB. We will start Today's discussion by seeing the
submitted papers for the conference.
In the end of August we will have our plan
presentation. And final presentation for the final year master student.
Next next time we will have long long discussion.
A notification of the conference submission will be on 19
this month. What is camera ready? Cameraready is the final
version of the paper which will be published on the
conference.
The photo based printing the hard copy of the paper
to the actual printing so historically it is called cameraready
the finally included paper for conference proceeding.
when you receicve the accepentance notification the author name should
be included and the paper need to modified according to
comment on the length of the paper and
the acceptance category like full paper,
short paper and poster presentation. If the paper is not
accepted then we will think about other confernece. We must
attend a conference to complete other master's degree.
if not accepted we need to quickly prepare the version
of the paper to submit in another conference. Another thing
is what is registration to the conference?
In most case credit card can be used to pay
the registration fee. Sensei will negotiation with the adminstritive staffs.
After receiving the notification sensei will give more detailed instructions
and
M2 students will have to do some more works and
prepare for the presentation and prepare for the theis and
the registration starts 18 June.
you have prepare your thesis in parallel.
Becareful about the deadlines for the 2nd year master's student
and about physical condition.
Rafi san discussion with Sensei
Multi agent system means more than one agent and Rafi
san's approach was single agent approach which contradicts with the
title of the paper which is a limitation.
It does not match with the thesis title. So he
should do some extra analysis regarding multi agent approach.
about the dynamic part of the title, Dynanic Vehicle control,
- the opposite side is static control sytem means the
car will have some way static way of responding,
like some learning approach stored in the car,
the car having some preprogrammed routine in the response of
the situation. the response is static.
for dynamic response is something better in the preprogrammed situation
that is actually included in our work.
When we use the LIMs for the every moment decision
the car should have this dynamic character.
In Accidental Condition: For this When we dont have the
internet connection is it can use dynamic decision using the
Llas.
For this We have think of the local LLms, In
local les we have to check the the performance in
this kind of situation and also the use of comenication
agent,
expand the result on Local LLms.
Communication: the meaning of this word in unclear, the statically
response of the communication agent.
Ask LLM about some effective communication
"What kind of additional cautions the car should send the
following cars, (in the radius)?"
In some exceptional case can car send some emergency message
to say stop?

----- TEXT:
This paper presents an innovative preliminary framework integrating Large Language
Models (LLMs) into a multi-agent system for autonomous vehicles, particularly
in unknown or unsafe traffic conditions. The authors introduce a
novel "Communication Agent" to facilitate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) information exchange, thereby
enhancing the context-awareness of the "Decision Agent." The experimental setup
using quantized LLMs and structured prompts is clearly described, with
initial findings showing promising improvements in consistency and reasoning when
using V2V data. The paper’s strengths lie in its practical
scenario modeling, systematic LLM evaluation, and thoughtful identification of consistency
challenges. However, the work is still in an early stage,
and lacks deeper quantitative analysis or deployment in realistic environments.
The proposed scenarios are simplified and would benefit from expansion
to cover more complex or edge-case conditions. Nonetheless, the research


opens a valuable direction for adaptive and explainable AV control
using LLMs. I recommend acceptance due to its novelty and
potential impact on safety and decision-making in AV systems.

----- TEXT:
This paper explores the potential integration of Large Language Models
(LLMs) within a multi-agent framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to
enhance decision-making in unknown and unsafe traffic situations. The proposal
of using LLMs as decision agents in combination with vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communication is novel and potentially valuable for improving autonomous
driving systems.

Weak points:
1. While the study evaluates multiple LLMs, it uses a
relatively small set of traffic scenarios, which can hardly present
the complex and real-world traffic situations.
2. The study highlights issues with consistency in the LLMs'
responses to identical traffic scenarios, which is a critical concern
for safety and reliability. However, it does not adequately address
how to mitigate the risks of LLM mistakes in the
decision-making process. In autonomous vehicles, inconsistent or incorrect outputs from
LLMs could lead to serious accidents, but the paper does
not propose effective fail-safe mechanisms, redundancy strategies, or real-time error
detection to ensure safety in such cases. This is a
critical issue that needs to be explored further to guarantee
the reliability and safety of the AV system.
3. While the paper investigates the effect of V2V communication
on decision-making, the results and analysis could be further elaborated.
How does the communication data impact decision accuracy compared to
scenarios without communication, and what are the potential risks or
drawbacks?
4. The proposed multi-agent system relies on V2V communication, which
might face challenges in scalability and real-time processing, especially in
dense traffic environments. The paper doesn’t explore potential limitations related
to network congestion or latency in real-world implementations.

This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) function as

actual traffic situations. This study is an interesting research utilizing
LLMs and is considered to be useful once completed.

At present, there are dependencies on the scenario, so mentioning
safety considerations in cases where the scenario cannot be anticipated
and designing the agent's behavior would improve the study. Additionally,
it is hoped that this research could provide guidelines for
the design of V2V protocols。

## 21.05.25 **Lab Meeting DM: paper submission suggestion:cameraready**

In last meeting i shared a issue that i was
confused that wheather my work and tittle is allign or
not.
because sensei warn us to be carefully chosse the tittle
if it doesnt match the work there is a chance
it couldnt be accepted.
- Need to expand results on Local LLMs performance
- for this i can use API(https://ollama.com/)

Sensei suggeseted way to

Sensei shared this link to check how the paper is
presented in the conference,
https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/program/accepted-papers/

This is a tutorial link for checking the related work
,
checking about this link see some materials from them will
be helpfull for the conference.

I have to check the pdf by sensei,


For the cameraready version preparation,
Please do not forget to add the author information on
the paper in the cameraready version.
Then keep the page limit it is the first
- template
What can be included,
we can not change drastically change in our paper, we
would keep the contenet as it is, for page policy
we would cut some text.
We have to check some errror, some worg figure number,
wrong spelling , wrong
The upadate the body of the paper please check the
minor error,

First add authors name
check minor errors
shrink the pages
some reply for the reviewer,

- paper validation system (PDF eXpress) by the help of
sensei.

**Note from Touhid san:**

Sensei briefed about the last lab meeting and said one
out of five papers were accepted in the iiai conference.
Some are full, short and poster paper depending on the
situation. Later we will discuss about the notification. To complete
the degree we must have to attend a conference out
of our campus before our completing our degree and we
M1 student should also not hesitate to submit paper in
the conference this year. Sensei ask us to follow some
conferences in advance:

Sensei discussion with Rafi san
sensei discussed about the comments made by the reviewers of
the conference. senseis comments don't forget to add author's name
and strictly follow the template provuided by the conference. we
cannot drastically change the paper from the submitted version if
no reviewers strictly recommend to do so so we will
keep the contents as it is. the reviewers have not
mentioned any mistake or errors in the notification but we
will check for different errors like grammatical, spelling and minor
errors. Sometimes we write wrong author and institution name so
we must be careful about these things. Becareful about the
deadline and using overleaf.

- Please do not forget to add the author information
with keeping paper limit
- If you used the template from some other older
students, it may be outdated. So make sure you are
using the latest version of the template.
- Unless reviewers say change or reflect the comments strongly,
you should update as-is for the camera-ready paper.
- These reviewers didn't mention errors that appear in the
paper in your case, but check again.
- After preparing adding author information, start checking small errors.
- author information? ordering? affiliation?
- Try to answer to the comments from reviewers (but
its priority is lower than above).
As the deadline is approaching, be careful about the environment
of compiling the paper.
(we experienced service down of overleaf in recent days)
Preparing very tentative version of the paper is also important.

going to upload the updated version to the slack channel.

## 28.05.25 **Lab Meeting DM**

Last lab meeting summerize,
In last lab meeting we have got out paper acceptance
result and reviewers comment. And we have briefly disscussed about
the comments and sensei give me some instruction what i
should do for the next step,
- Please do not forget to add the author information
with keeping paper limit
- If you used the template from some other older
students, it may be outdated. So make sure you are
using the latest version of the template. -> for this
i checked myself and i asked Takahashi san also and
he also confirmed that my paper is used the latest
template.
- These reviewers didn't mention errors that appear in the
paper in your case, but check again.
- After preparing adding author information, start checking small errors.
- author information? ordering? affiliation?
- Try to answer to the comments from reviewers but
this is less priority.


Some upcoming Schedule:

Coming friday is final date for upcoming conference,
to coming next friday, And next next 3 weeks friday
from 12.45 to the lab will be used for giving
some information about our lab to the
japanese student and do some Q/A session.
At these time the lab will be busy for this,
and if we are welcome to join.
The next coming deadline for the coming the thesis tittle
submission - two weeks before the actual deadline , we
will have necassary disscussion on next meeting. most possibly.

Our preparation for the conference will also help us to
be prepare for the thesis defence

Sensei suggested the M1 students to prepare two page abstract
paper in IEEE format.


Disscussion with toufik san,
- Can we use the same title which has been
used at the paper which was submitted to another conference
(to the registration of some new (domestic/international) conference?
- Should we have some updates about the content of
the research from the previously submitted papers (since these updates
will also be reflected to the title of the newly
made presentations at the domestic conference/symposium)
- for the first questions answer yes he can use
the same tittle because he's paper has not been accepted
for the previous conference.
For the second question for the toufik sans matter there
will be no reviewer for this conference and the organizer
will be the checker. and the content and the tittle
should be have some similarity.

I have updated my paper and uploaded the paper and
mistakenly i have uploaded my paper twice and i asked
sesnei for help and sensei suggeseted me to update with
the same pdf for the both submission.

## 2.06.25

the the thesis tittle submission deadline for the tittle.

## 3.06.25

Last dissscussion summerization:
In our last disscussion we have thoroughly checked my papaer
wheater it is in order or not we also chceked
these two points,
(Please do not forget to add the author information with
keeping paper limit, If you used the template from some
other older students, it may be outdated. So make sure
you are using the latest version of the template.)
And in later moment in friday we succesfully checked and
upload our cameraready paper for conference.

## 4.06.25 **Lab Meeting DM**

Current issuses,
- About he presenataion slides
- Thesis tittle

Today is the Thesis tittle submission, we gonna check our
tittle to ready for the thesis.
And for M1 last of this month,
In next month kanamori kun and toufik san will submit
their paper for the symposium. and sensei suggested to have
some disscussion with kanamori san for the details paper format
the symposium.
For the domestic symposium sensei set some event date for
the local organization. and sensei is the
organizer committe.

Disscussion about thesis tittle:
"Toward a Multi Agent Approach for LLM-Based Dynamic Vehicle Control
and Communication in Accidental Condition"
- Chossing this one is safe.(we can extend the thesis
work, )
- about the extension , run the same promt 20
times is ok but 100 times may be better or
1000 times is more clear result.
- think about the setting up some new experiment and
also increase the number of try.
- 100 pages for thesis writing.
-> Toward a Multi Agent Approach for LLM-Based Dynamic Vehicle
Control and Communication to avoid Accidental Condition
- for this i have to clearly mentioned about what
kind of condition we can avoid
these are not complete evaluation, mention this in the tittle
And about the experiment ->

Thesis presentation, may be the same slide can be used
, the same version used for the conference.
- i can add the recent result.

## 5.06.25

Note from takahashi san:
pm 14:36
rf
Today's is the deadline for the lab for registering the
thesis title for 2nd grande master.
domestic symposium you have to submit your paper. The instituion
therefore IEEE conference style.
From our laboratory to the exactly same domestic symposium, when
you successfully submit their manuscript to.
He already know I already told
your title for your plan presentation.

Some discussion for 2nd grade master students.
Preparing manuscript.
What kind of plan presentation all over you research plan
only the applicant writing of has been accepted.

About the at the time of we are living now,
therefore we may create a new conference.
Publishing the paper countinously is very important, next 100 years,
I hope those factor is important.
Don't try conference paper randomly, probably 20 years or so,
even from these 2 3rd tear conference.
On your situation, it is so difficult to especially in
this field.
We carefully read very small number of journal paper, especially
in our field, journal paper review is so long sometimes
it reaches 1 or 2 years.
Because of these reasons, the main research of those journal
papers has done in 3 or 4 years ago maybe.
So be careful about it especially in our field(depending on
laboratory's research topics).

pm 14:56
seeing email
presentation time will be 25 minutes for full paper.
Even in top conferences they do not assign such a
long time for presentations.
Still now, the actual schedule for presentations is uncertain(which date
is your presentation date is not mentioned yet).
So let's see last year's schedule as a reference.

The last presentation: 15min, QA: 7min
Actual presentation was 13min and I used 20 pages of
slides.
So this time, I will prepare 30 pages of slides.

pm 15:12
It is somewhat risky, including new content which its result
is not yet confirmed into the thesis title.
For now, we have made the simulation event for the
LLMs we actually run two types of events to the
LLMs,
informal information and successfuly achived the result.
And the other was we have this kind of result.
Which kind of you can utilize
We do not know.
Figure which canbe utilized? let's see.
We result may not be changed I hope.
Some screenshots maybe OK.

So only having 2 is enough?
But these part extended part in your research, into your
thesis content.
When we also trying including that part into the thesis
title is risky in terms of its consistency or so.
...Because full evaluation is not yet done. We have initial
result.
Experimentation?

f. How to logically get the way of getting thesis
title is important.

So just utilizing the same title for the conference paper
is one safe option.

umm... start from this existing title:
"Towards a Multi Agent Approach for LLM-Based Dynamic Vehicle Control
and Communication in Accidental Conditoin"

Possible short discussion is including "accidental condition" or not.
Experimentation does not cover the all of cases to be
covered.
(...missing)
Let's compare to different version.
(missing)
pm 15:26
Some specific output or result yourself.
Knowing these general knowledge is important.

extending the content is important but more important thing is
having the evaluation to get more the stability or confidence.

At least just 3 times of trial is not enough.
www.

You can increase the number for the simulation you have
already done.
...Truly expected the action, then so the case we have
we have 3 lanes, and 3 cars and some similar
conditions.
But in your case, since you do not mention "avoid"
in your title, so you are lucky and having the
such a result is OK even it is differ from
the expected one.
Having(Organizing) strucual multiple tasks is very important.

## 5.06.25 - 7.06.25

I took a vacation, between these days i have joined
EID ul Adha and did my prayer and have some
party with the M1 students. I felt really relexed after
a very long time i took this vacation and in
few days the like would be heptic again.

## 9.06.25

About the thesis, there is a certain format to be
followed in our lab, i tried to run the files
from suma sans format but in first apporch i showed
some error and it didnt complete because of the long
run time.
Then i tried to delete the pdf and some images
from the project and sucessfully run the code.
Now i am trying to update my contents in the
format.

## 10.06.25

I got the final dates for upcoming events:

June 18th (Wednesday) Deadline for submitting master's thesis titles
July 25th (Friday) Deadline for submitting master's thesis manuscripts for
review (to each review committee member)
August 8th (Friday) Final exam (presentation) (*Summer break 8/14-8/19)
August 22nd (Friday) Deadline for submitting final draft of master's
thesis (noon)
September 9th (Tuesday) Graduation ceremony

For now i am trying to update the presentation slides
,


## 11.06.25 **Lab Meeting DM**

**There is updated deadline tittle submission for M1 in 7/9.**
this week the deadline of the symposim.
And next week we have the deadline for the thesis

about SMASH25
about the how long they will stay there:
end of first session?
1 day before starting. 2 nights in sapporo hokkaido
After submitting initial version, you have to start booking hotel
and flight.
You have to do these things with knmr.
In that case, if we could not book good hotel,
we have to stay at airport without any blanket, right?
So this is very important.

important: you must enter the room for presentation before the
time of beginning of the session **NOT the time of
your presentation**.

which link is the link to submit your manuscript? Let's
find it from the registration email.

Therefore what you have tried are different far from there
from actual things actually should be done.
Don't forget and hesitate to ask again and again.
This confirmation is very important when you join to some
Japanese companies.
If you don't ask and confirm, other members of the
company just think you have already understood.
→ So be careful about it.

15:40
tfk is recalling what he will do after submitting very
tentative paper to the site.
f. Try explain by your words! and for other students,
if you are in his situation, how do you give
me the answer?

??? f. answer: Cooperation with knmr to book hotel and
flight immidiately. ← this is what I asked you to
do.

Flight plan review using Google Maps and Ekitan search.

16:17
knmr started to search for flight tickets using the site,
エアトリ.

プレミアムエコノミーはとると事務処理めんどくさい．空きが全然無くて仕方ない場合は例外．
行きと帰りで経路は揃えよ．ダメ→ 行きは羽田，帰りはセントレア．
マージンが必要 = 理想はフライトの2時間前に空港に到着すること．
エアトリのような串刺しサイトで検索すると実際の航空会社のサイトで予約する場合と価格が異なる場合がある．
したがっておおよその目安をつけたら航空会社のサイトで直接検索するのがよい．
慣れていない場合はエアラインとしてANAやJALを利用するべし．なぜならトラブったときの振替をしてくれる可能性が他社より高いため．

first, let's confirm the conference schedule
SMASHのサイト，リンク壊れていた．直したとはいえ，日本語で書かれたそのサイトから情報を得させるのはABP修士の人には難しいよな．

16:30
issue just for choosing different 2 versions for models, right?
Another question is do we have to follow some format
on thesis writing? f. yes; check DVD disks by elder
students.
Also in case overleaf is down in the day of
the deadline, you cannot compile your thesis.
So to secure your chance, having local environment for latex
compilation is very good.

Try having discussion about what prevent you from making slides
(some tasks of adding some additional results?) rather than having
some small changes on the versions.
f. Try practicing.
first, copy your previous presentation file and rename it as
those of the conference (and for thesis final defence presentation).
second, add a slide at very latter part of that
file.
Do not add some additional text to middle part but
into the latter part.
Very small tricks and small steps are very important.
"Oh I am making a slide page but it is
not for presentation, easy easy///"
third, copy and paste figures into slides even they are
Copy from latex source because copying from PDF often cause
some problems.
Do not worry too much about remaining latex commands in
the slide and figures is not contained in the slide.
(We can adjust them later. Having the initial version is
very important)
Entire content is contained in the slide. This is so
important to correctly select which slide to show in the
presentation.

Therefore for first grade master student, about this part, you
will face to this exact same issue in next year.
Try capturing information which you missed.

You can do by help of my pressure to you.
Pressure sometimes helps you to do some tasks like adding
texts to your 2 pages abstract.
Through these practices, you should be experienced.
→ When you are asked by a young student, you
can answer to them these exactly same thing.


## 13.06.25

I am updating my presentation from, also i am trying
to reflect he the reviewers comment on the presentation .

## 16.06.25

About thesis writing may be i need to shift to
offline and i got some suggestion from takahashi san to
try texshop for intregated latex. I am working on that

## 18.06.25 **Lab Meeting DM**

Last meeting summerization,

We have tried to update my presentation from scratch.

Current isssues,
- confused about the Challanges and future work slide
- need sensei's comment in other part.

Some upcoming Schedule:
This weekend, in our campus we will have electricity shutdown.
Today is thesis tittle submission deadline for M2 and sensei
have already succesfully done that.
And last week friday was the deadline of submitting the
symposim for toufis san, and mention about
air ticket, and other reciept.

For M2 submitting the thesis is scheduled 7/25.this would be
the instructed by the reviewers and they may asked about
the printed version of thesis.

**Sensei suggestion , please complete thesis writing before 7/9**

Do at least what you can do before july.
Final submission deadline for thesis 8/22 - maybe on noon
be careful about that matter.

abot the presenataion, how we could make some presenataion slide.
Detailed disscussion aobut the plan presenataion tittle with M1

Disscussion with toufik san,
- Writing thesis what would be goal or the right
way is not known to me.

When the mind is sticking to what should i do
please try to convert this to what can i do.
Think about what can we do about this.

Updating the reseach quality is not enough single importance,
we have to be concern about our easy writhing way
that could be understad by the
reviewer.
- Writing qualification is also important.
- In case you have paper that has been accepted
to some second grade international conferance it is safe like
easy to make understad this work is Significent
- For toufik sans case he has to prove this
point in his thesis.
When you are worrying about research
- try update your research quality
- try to make easy understaning easy readablity in your
thesis and your talk
Just listening others talk is also important becuse how easy
we can explaing our research is important

Curent issue is updating slides is updating the slides

Disscussion with me:

In near future work, what kind of extension we will
have can be mentioned.
By doing some validation we will confirim we will decide
what is ok or not?
We would like to know with slides are worng to
share in some international conferance,

To tell them we need to mention what kind of
current work we are following and what extention we are
having,
we have mention this thing clearly

The background issue why this slides gonna present to this
position.
clarify some standard we followed in our research.

What can we do for that, some current result on
this topic by some others.
when i am trying to prepare some presentation think
who would be the audience, some of them would not
be the same field and some would be some expert.
mention about some related work would be nice,
can utilize TED,
Presentation skill without content,- presenting veery smart
- why we are doing this , what would be
the benifits
- why is this slide , what is it explaining
- Joining other presenataion is important to undersatand how easily
we can explain our own research
using this experience.

About presentation preparation,
havig disscussion with some seniors about what kind of issue
they faced during their conferance
Have eyes on the weather forecast.
knowing about some areas before visiting is good/important

Some other operation some ai is being asked some validation
of the code asked by the user,
Do something
the computation time in a dense AV,

There some other issue, there are deadline and some of
experiment are not done yet , what can we do
for that.
this is a issure to be disscussed in this moment,

Making some dense situaiton of the car, maybe easy ,
and calculating the expected time,

How can we set up some accidental scenario could be
current issue,
the one wrongly seeing the signal and the following cars
also follw the car,


About the human and AV scenario add one more car
and first car see the human and send emergency message
to other car to stop.
Checking about accident car data to having emergency road coverage
lenght.
To clarify about my try would help to answering some
question from the final thesis presentation.
- what king of step i took
- did i asked others for their idea.

Calclutating the time what can we do in this short
preiod.

To all,
Clarification of the self work is very important, what is
done before and what kind of improvement we are proposing
is important.




## 20.06.25
Note from takahasi san,
16:24
We gonna switch another discussion with Rafi

What kind of discussion about research is my question, sensei
said. Reminding is important here.
r. At last last meeting, we discussed about the thesis
title.
That is also related to the
What kind of result we can have there.
Some reality simulation setup somewhat very easy to understand.
What we discussed about some more complicated difficult situation
What kind of issues you are having now?
r. I have completed the preliminary version of the slides.
r. In my presentation, what kind of future work should(can)
I mention?
f. you have some answer about them?
r. This was 1 or 2 lines explanation is it
OK?
You already know why don't you write it down as
some "near" future work?

Another question about
One reminder is when you ask is this OK we'd
like to know by inference and logical validation.

What kind of existing research we are trying to explain
these kind of these things.
If we have reason to why, we don't have any
criteria to show things is OK or not.

Your issues the form
I am this slide how the audience know I can
give.
On the conference, interdiciplinary conference. We are integrating different topics
into one.
Therefore clarifying some base standard to those outside researchers is
important.

(... what sensei said here was hard to interpret to
me...)

16:46
(missed some sentences and restarted at 17:05)
17:05
r. And also communication will dense of vehicle there, so
many information would be shared. That moment, finding right information
is also matter.
Then, issue on doing such simulation?
I caught this is very important said if the LLM
made decision, no current system have fail-safe macanism.
Extended senario of v2v communication, we haven't with wrong decision.
We can put from your side, maybe observed
much more safe than just single prompt-answer, in another field
of code writing some systems are trying to ask the
AI to validate to update if the result is matches
to user's request or not.
You can first and then also in other field, trying
to how can we do can be mentioned on there.
Are there so back to the when the number of
in specific place time on the computation to get the
result, what kind of limitation is when we will be
the submission is alredy decided.
Doing some experiment time is limited, then we cannot these
complete the experimantation.
We gonna prepare some new machine ask AWS to rent
more powerful machine.
Why doing this is not easy is as all of
you already so here when we are feeling great pressure,
to start thinking about actually important issues (like discussed now).
And now, we did some of this I hope. So
now you are starting thinking about them.
Just making some dense situation of car may be easy.
→ Then, what we would ...
wrong
It utilize commercial services.
Increasing the accidental situation, ...

---

17:16

(About extending the situation)

As a starting point we can start from current situation.

2 cars with light

So for example, they can see signal other cannot see
signal. ← current senario.
One see wrongly follows the front car. another signal...

Prepare some accidental condition, right?
Someone for help some other similar different situation.
Also some level of generality.
Thinking different situation coverage give noticed will increase coverage.

next question will be coverage is enoguh or not.

17:23
We have some in every country checking these data may
be help to see the coverage.
Immidiately receiving, thinking about I don't have enough time to
do everything.
Having discussion with someone is very helpful.
I can work with you.
Time consuming task
When you already to clarify the difficulties, that most skip
doing at the time of thesis presentaion, what would happen?

Our planning ability to do everything go safe is somewhat
opposite optimazation.
Optimized for very easy situation.
Such natural intuitive optimization does not work well in our
difficult situation like research.

You can do many things to update your thesis.
If you want utilize more computational resources, you can ask
me to help you.
Actually, some Japanese students already asked me to bring additional
GPU to the lab.

---

For 1st grade master cource students.

What is important here(starting point of research) respecting what is
already done there as well as what issue we are
having now.
Therefore, citation is very important. Check if your manuscript includes
some references to the existing research.
Some paper contain references part, no actual citation on the
body was found though.
One great hint is "don't try reading those cited papers".

If in case, imagine your plan presentations are held in
close time slot, proffessor listen one and he will listen
the next talk too.
Then in some cases, he would ask sensei "Is this
presentation same with previous one?".
So saying difference and significance you are going on to
do is also important.

## 25.06.25 **Lab Meeting DM**

last meeting summerization:
To tell them we need to mention what kind of
current work we are following and what extention we are
having, we have mention this thing clearly

**Practical Preparation Tips,**
Presentation skill without content,- presenting veery smart
- why we are doing this , what would be
the benifits
- Without explaining why, it's difficult to evaluate if something
is "OK" or not.
- why is this slide , what is it explaining
- Joining other presenataion is important to undersatand how easily
we can explain our own research
using this experience.

*Do something the computation time in a dense AV*
What kind of future work can be included in the
presentation?
Are 1–2 line explanations enough?
- Sensei implied they are too short and suggested writing
"near-future work" more clearly with reasons and logical links.

Current issue,
- Another suggestion from you was, Do something the computation
time in a dense AV,

In a dense if multiple AV shares their information that
would be huge and summerizing the information is an another
issue, what can we do for that. can we mention
it as issue and future work.

- what can we do for handle incorrect LLM outputs
- try some emergency message or action that will take
LLM if failed to interpreat

- About thesis writing, i have seen seniors thesis and
it is bit confusing, if you can give us some
suggestion what can we add and what are prohabitate

**Future Sceudle for me for the conference,**

July 17 (Thu) 1:00PM-2:40PM Room A
SCAI 7 Session Chair: TBA


Sharing information for more than 15 cars, it would show
the complication, And i can do for the interim work....

Ther should be some clarification, what kind of dense the
LLM can take the right decision, And can see the
capacity of the different LLM ,


What can we do in the backup plan ,
for LLM would the other option to minimize the damage
Next step what can the car do or some other
sorrounding car can do.

Can we avoid this accidental situation , changing some shared
informaton.
Some vision system is being used and not result found
, and someone is working on this.


Learning capabilities for this LLM like what it has failed
to do in previous action, what is mission in the
past case.

The promt, what happen in short doing in the the
thesis.


About thesis writing,
- Try see PHd thesis, not masters thesis. Try putting
goal on higher.
- See some pHd thesis form some good university.
- These thesis are reviewed paper or journal. compare these
paper and the thesis and you can found...

- Thinking some difficult situaiton is important to learn something
throughout the process.
Why conferance paper why thesis why masters why phd

Fight against this feeling and taking some of result is
Important

About the slide,
think about consistancy,
- About the extended scenario only Chatgpt-4, we can add
some result form other LLM also.
- check, if we say anything it is problem wheather
we have mention about it in the conclusion.
-

Disscussion with tauhid san:
Optimization is not the top priority. what would be the
core?
After this congestion you can reach 6km far charging station
is it really ok.

- Another suggestion from you was, Do something the computation
time in a dense AV -
Sharing information for more than 15 cars, it would show
the complication, And i can do for the interim work....

Ther should be some clarification, what kind of dense the
LLM can take the right decision, And can see the
capacity of the different LLM ,

In a dense if multiple AV shares their information that
would be huge and summerizing the information is an another
issue, what can we do for that. can we mention
it as issue and future work.

- what can we do for handle incorrect LLM outputs
- try some emergency message or action that will take
LLM if failed to interpreat

What can we do in the backup plan ,
for LLM would the other option to minimize the damage
Next step what can the car do or some other
sorrounding car can do

- About thesis writing, i have seen seniors thesis and
it is bit confusing, if you can give us some
suggestion what can we add and what are prohabitate

## 9.7.25

Last meeting disscussion,

Sensei asked me last meetings recap and got suggestion writing
thesis from the conslusion not the introduction,
I showed the intermediate results from the next step scenario,
and the updated version of the slides and uploaded the
slides for review.


current issue ,
need some practice session on presentation?
thesis is on the fire , need review from sensei,


What can we do,
try writing up nice thesis in point of our view,
we alreday have some validation mechanism -
Also clear meaning of the figures , explanation of the
numbers,
For my case i have some intermidate result, e
The thesis containing , what we can do we can
follow
dont use undefied words, do proper citation.
consistancy of the writing - like the difference between the
introduction and conclusion.

Hint about the introduction:

on the conference paper we metioned aobut the past work
- very recent paper we have citation.
But in thesis we can use some historical paper as
reference, - in the field
this should be connected to the core research

In introduction part add the research question.

Writing about the structure description, can be written in the
conclusion.

Try realizing the goal of other approches,




## 14.07.25


first day at the conference,
non task oriented dialouge in human relationships
to develop a dialouge system that builds a long term
trusting,
automatically extractiong human relationship terms associated with person names.
question : how to use this relationship , and i
didnt get your research objective.

Automatic weed control robot in paddy field.
dataset is limited total number of images 217 very low

Speech Emotion Recognition - this work is interesting
the reviewer asked that he think there are some work
already have been done , comparing would be good for
you.
and the speaker said they are working for on the
speech emotion recognation, not facial emotion recognation.

customer analysis and text genaration for small retail store.
man made pop texts.
LLM genarated pop texts
the approch is to combinig the human and LLM.
the time of this work the evaluation time should be
less you mentioned but in conclusion you didnt mention that
,
About the system architecture, the system asking the quesiotn and
the user responsing with yes or no.
The third reviewer asked can you input images

The review setting up the 0.9 temp, why did he
set up the temp.
and what validation he used to can be explained in
next extension.

What is your contribution,
our contribution is to clarify the
OPRO is already used mechanism , comparing OPRO and LLM
is not good work


## 15.07.25

MOT - multiple object tracking.
shadow of tree make tis challangeing the subject can be
tracked.

Sensei asked can we see the slides, how did it
the
how we could identify , how this detection is important.


Query on LLM minimizing time:


## 16.07.25


## 17.07.25

I joined only one presentation . i barely undestand that


When we do kusoripu , we become stressed, can we
stop this kusoripu,
some people
the receiver of kusoripu is affected not the sender what
to do with the sender.



**Memo from Sensei,**
Here is my quick memo of the QA session for
your talk: (might contain some errors, also refer others notes
as well)
-------
Q (by Hayashi-sensei) LLM might be slow so is it
possible to apply such a realtime task? Don't you use
a two-layered approach which employs immediate-responding layer with slower responding
one?
(Note: see R. Brooks's "subsumption architecture" for details, which has
been utilized in the robotics field!)
A. Future work...
Q (By Session Chair) About the UI (probably it means
the API design), why don't you utilize a streaming API
(to connect to the LLM) rather than such a text
based chatting interface?
A. I have seen some researches that were doing it.
In the next step...

**Memo from takahashi san,**
4人目はRafiさん 18min
QA
by Dr. Hisashi
I just thought LLMs are slow so it is not
appropriate to emergency situation
reactive and proactive behaivior are needed in robotics area
special very fast communication
in v2v some human beings we need
separated
these kind of ideas are often emploied in the field
of robotics
2nd comment: more complicated conversation example can we see?
r. use number of information how actually level of LLM
h ave to recon??? appropriate decision. more than more veihcle
consisely making a important ??? another you will reconstruct decision
you need good scenario
by Dr. Nakanishi
current interface is chat format, right? your application is for
driving / you have to change interface toward processing streaming
data (as driving have to treat streaming data)
r. Yes I also think so.


## 23.07.25 **Lab Meeting DM**


Disscussion with Touhid , Visually reach mock up easier
Think about the benifit of doing this, we dont think
about the implementation,
When we have the implementation the problem would the rearrangement
of items.

then it would be difficult to make the initial mockup.

Sensei suggested to you have implemented something write it down
in the paper.
Doing things in parallaly is not .
- Mockup is the main focus.

Disscussion with aji,
First when you start working with mockup you are not
using anything in lab , you dont need to ask
me,
And about some clarification about is it ok is it
the right decision, We dont know if we know that
already that is
not research. We are trying to find it,
Preparaing mockup is not easy, doing is not hard but
starting is not easy.


on the mockup what will be shown should be the
main focus,
In the research what would be done some internal structure
should be shown.

Disscussion with misho san,

About research note, you should write about worries on the
research note,
You having some disscussion,
Start thinking about this is not so easy. write this
line in your research note may be it would the
starting point

Research note writing is actually important because from that you
can clarify your issuses and worries.

Some more details about your research and in one week
we can see your initial mockup.


**Next Phase :**

Toufik sans writing style is different from others thesis,


## 24.07.25

I am updating my thesis.

## 25.07.25

i have followed senseis comment and updated my thesis and
finally submitted for review.

## 29.07.25

About research there is final defense in 8/8. Currently it
will be updating the presentation slides and
getting prepare for the presentation.

## 30.07.25 **Lab meeting**

Last meeting summarization, we have disscussed about our conference and
saw some picture. And then we shared some images of
the conferences event to the others.
And after that we just waited for your comments on
the thesis.

In next friday we will have some new japanese student.
And next next friday we have our final presentation.

From the next to next next week the campus will
be closed 14 to 21.. 12 and 13 main holiday-
the lab meeting(8/13) will be skipped. 28- 29 will be
plan presentation for M1.

8/20 sensei have a scheduled for joining anoter sensei, and
this is under rearrangement - there is possiblity to have
the meeting.

And 8/22 - friday, is deadline for our thesis, what
can ---- at noon of that day.

On september, the schedule is not fixed.


the differnce is , in the ordinary research presentation what
is the improvement to the scocity.

and in campus presentation , argur on the context why
i should get diploma, i have to clerly mention or
argue why i am
I have clearly say what i did.

Include Achivement the published paper.
Underline or bold my name.

clarify in which part i have spend my effort.
Improvement in the time of thesis writing can be mentioned.


## 01.08.25

i have update some slides caption.

## 02.08.25

Updating the future work slide.


## 05.08.25


## 06.08.25 **Lab meeting**

On friday m2 have ..

On 8/20, the metting would be start on 4 p.m

Last disscussion summerization,

In an academic research presentation, the focus is on how
the research contributes to society or advances the field technically.
However, in a campus graduation presentation,
the goal is to clearly justify why I deserve the
degree by explaining what I did, how much I contributed,
and the efforts I made during the research.
Include Achivement the published paper.Underline and bold my name.
clarify in which part i have spend my effort.(there are
no co-author other than sensei)
Improvement in the time of thesis writing can be mentioned.

Also suggest to rename some slide (next step -> future
work)



Which version of LLMs did you used on your work.you
didnt mentioned.?
Which kind of difference you have done in your work
vs the related work.
What is the research aim and core contribution of your
work?

try switching right slide
You didnt metion your research question that is good


Deleted some Our approch talk that are not mentioned in
the tesis.
Final suggestion to toufik san, to present the slides on
exactly 20 minutes you can just show the slides 3-6
just mentioning i have presented this on my plan and
midterm presentation and now i am skipping the details. And
doing this you can finish your talk on time sensei
hope.


for slide 6 add some evidance to say this "Unknown
Situations: Traditional systems struggle with truly unfamiliar scenarios that weren't
included in training data"

At slide 11, also add some references about the quantization.
About some updated model having some schene shorts can be
provided.

At slide 30 delete some future work that can be
done immediately.

Computation time i never mentioned, the time ?
In some new modles ... can be say something about
computational time.


dont upgrade your research final suggestion.



## 07.08.25

I have updated my thesis presentation and send it to
the professors for review.


## 8.08.25

in page6: "infinitely scenario" you wrote. how many do simple
scenarios exist?
Tricky thing is when we say for... how many do
you use? initilally.
In your how many scenario did you use in this
research? Initially... 3.

## 12.08.25

It seems now we can access to the IEEE version of the proceedings of AAI2025 conference from confaid conference registration page! 
You can download the paper (with IEEE copyright version, also with page numbers) from there!


## 13.08.25

Actually i am feeling so much pressure, From family and kepping head on is becoming so much hard
i think .
Anyway i am trying my best.

## 18.08.25

What i have to do to complete the degree,

1. update the paper with the published paper 
-   update the publishing slide with updaetd information

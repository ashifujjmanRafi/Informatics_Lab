Sunday was funday and i have no class and i tried to get familiar with latex and successfully wrote an initial research prosal for todays (11.14.23)meeting. 

## 23.11.13

yes sensei last day was cold also. and i have two class to attend , one was in the morning at 8.00 am and the another was at 12.45 , that was your class.

## 23.11.14

writing research note is essential to remember to what happed last time and to remember the task we were assign last time. we can write anything that sensei suggested for practacing. 

Sensei tell us that at the beganing it will be difficult for us, and suggested to upgrade our typing speed, and strongly suggested to writhing the research note. sometimes we might we fail to write down some research note then today is not yesterday , sometime we have to write everything , that will be good practice, and strongly suggested to the past note. last day he forgot to write down his notes, he also write the past notes. wheather he remembers. suggest to put a date and write whatever we remember. asked us to write last date research note and not to be worried about past days and suggested to practice from now on. sensei showing us to how to write note propely.

**Poster presentation**
Sort time to describe the poster, and content is important , poster should be self contained, and understadable to the audience. Sabbir vai asked how to make understand the audience the background story?
Sensei told to prepare some live demonstration, or movies atlest prepare some laptop or tab.Sabbir san asked sensei to demonstrate a poster presentation,Sensei suggested to search some university poster presentation. Sensei mention about UMBC university.

## 23.11.15

Next thursday is national holiday.<br>
[Workshop_on_Informatics](https://sites.google.com/view/winf2023/home),Deadline-last of this month.

Sensei suggested to take all classes before next march.13-14 of next january there will be entrance exam and we are strictly prohabited in campus.suggested to present on the presentation.
Sensei reviwed sabbir sans paper comment.

- [x] Sensei told us to convert our research proposal to IEEE format and  
- [x] Take research note properly.


## 23.11.28

**Conference && presentation GuideLine**
IIAI 2023 conference after the workshop.
Practice poster presentation as early as possible,and suggested sabbir san to start pesenting the poster. Practice to find the right content that should indicate the research theme. 
Do plan before write slide for any presentation otherwise that can miss some checking.
**Getting a plan is important before doing anything and thinking about what i am going to do** Research notes are important for improving to update the research things or anything assigned and this can be helpfull for the juniors for understading the situation how gonna the research should operate or any details about the situations.<br>**Before preparing slide for the presentation we need to do a proper plan, important thing is to getting a little bit prepare for the actual presentation.**
In conference presentation we dont have share our actual planning wheather we can share our planning after 6 months or after graduate what we gonnna do.Make some summarization about our presentation and what question can be asked is a good thing before presenataion,-getting comment from slack channel and answerig them can be a good way to preparaing for presenatation and we have to do crosscheck with our actual content. 
**To iftekhar san :** get comment from the audience can they relate the content with the actual theme or not. Some text explanation in poster is ok, some poster are for only for presentation and some poster need a presenter, ours gonna be secenond one. 

## 23.11.29

I was sick today , my pressure gone high , i rested whole day.

## 23.11.30

Today i have the first exam experience at japan , it was nihongo midterm exam. Though my preparation was not so good but i tried so hard and it is a relif. And i had only one class and then came to dormitory and cooked for myself.

## 23.12.1

I got an arubaito and today i have scheduled 7 to 11 am , then i have done my prayer at 12 pm and then i have a class at 12.45 and i joined that. There was a group presentation and my role was to time management , in which slide how much time need to use and which slide is just to show i tried to plan this out.

## 23.12.2

Saturday i tried to practice some nihongo , and watch one episode of "Jujutshu kaisen". I cooked for myself at night and practice nihongo at duolingo. 

## 23.12.3

Sunday there was no class , i woke up at 10 and try to learn some nihongo. And also i tried to solve a problem in leetcode but it seems hard and i became disapointeed and started watching a anime "Tokyo Revenge"

## 23.12.4

I have some work in eki , i wake up early and went to eki. Then i have a class or Data engineering but the class was cancelled at the last moment, i was in the class and wait sometime , then i have another class at 2.25, and make a group and choose a topic and in next class we do have a presentation.


## 23.12.5

**Sabbir San :** Presentation slided ,  at first page Add subject name and mention all the authors who helped to make sucess the research. Add more slides to explain some more things. **Poster presentation time is like 1 min, the main idea is to explain**, if someone asked more, there we could use more time. 
The main objective of his research is to identify an auction based approch that helps to create a paraller task allocation schedule vased one task preference  and path collision avoidance.
  - [ ] Novel methods can be developed to  proactivity detect and resolve and collision between robots in real time during task allocatin and execution.
  - [ ] Finding effective way to priotize tasks in multi robot task allocation system.
  - [ ] How the path planning algorithms be intregated.

At my understading it should be in this way like first problem statement -> Impletementation Design -> Limitation and Conclusion.

**Suma san :**Where to park the car? managing overstaying vehicles in parking lots , optimising efficiency of path planning : algorithm is used vest path finging algorithm
**Practice over and over untill it match the time expectation**

## 23.12.6

I have only one class today programming language, i missed two lecture, i tried to catch up , Sensei also give a review. I noted some key point and i think i can catch up. After the calss i came back home and tried to solve a problem in leetcode. And also practice some nihongo.

## 23.12.7

There was a nihongo class at 8.40 . I have joined it and i think 

## 23.12.8

I have done my prayer at 12 pm and then i have a class at 12.45 and i joined that. There was a session about yamaha company a guest lectuare tried to expline japanease work culture, hows important is mental health and how many holiday i can got after getting job. And there was a Session that says what gonna excite me in workspace.

## 23.12.9

I got an arubaito and today i have scheduled 9 to 2 pm, it was my first day without any trainer , it was hard undersatand their command but soon i catch up and it was a great experience.

## 23.12.10

Today there was an workshop Workshop_on_Informatics , many student was gathered most of them were japnease and some internatinal student. I went there and three of my senior presented their idea. Sabbir san, Shuvo san and Suma san. Sabbir sans idea is to develope a sytem where multiple robot on a supershop or factory can work under a centralized administration, if any task is assigned the robots will decide itself which work it will to based on shortest path finding avoiding collision with other robot , and if multiple task and multiple robot are assign they will do the same , first calculate for whom its efficient and then do the job, his presentation tittle was **Parallel Task Allocation in Multi-robot Environment under Uncertainty based on Auction Mechanism**. Next i visit suma san and her idea is to solve parking problem in parking lot according individuals choice. Basically she introduced a problem where if anyone wanted to park a car several issue arise like someone wants to park beside the main exit or close to bathroom, and how to manage those car which are parked for a long time and another thing if two or more car wanted to park in same which one get more priority. I think solving this problem is little bit tricky because our mind changes certainly.
Then i visi shuvo san, his idea is to find a path for electic viacle with available charging point based on if there is available point acoording my car battery life , can i use them or not because there will be a advance booking system. If there is more choice that satisfy the first condition then choose the sortest path. His idea is cool i think because i think in future there will be more electrical viacle and we need this kind of app or system. I also tried to understand other japanease students idea but their idea was written on japanease that i beraly understand and i asked if they can explain their idea but that dosnt work out. The presentation was closed at 2.15 and i came back to my room. It was really a great experience.

## 23.12.11

I have two classes today one was cancelled Data engineering and another class was in 2.25 pm and i have group presentation , describe a cyber attack happen in my country. I made a three page presentation about the incident Bangladesh bank Money heigst happend in 2016. 


## 23.12.12

International conference presentation is about 20 min. Sensei suggested sabbir san to to find out those question background those he get in wiNF by himself. The most question was like,
**why he use centralized auctioner insted of decentralized** In his research he planned conduct it **centralized auction based system** because he were planning to use a centralized server that will be responsible for task allocation and path planning. 

**How many robot you are planning to simulate in your model and if he simulate them how he is gonna do that** Initially his planning is to make a simulation based on few number of robot. After the simulation he will compare it with other researcher model and then take the decision.
Or this can be we gonna run multiple simulation taking different number of robot like 5 then 10 then 15 and we will compare the result and then we can go ahead to our actual planning.
**some ask about how to conduct the experiment, ask the evaluation technique**
Dont have to answer every question according out instinct, without backgruound knowledge its better not to answer all the question rather we can clarify what we can do about out experience.
**There should some limitation describe in the presentation slide** not own limitation but the limitation of the research. **answering the question , change the the slide to relevent slide and then answer the question,**

IIAI AAI 2024: [https://iaiai.org/conference/aai2024/]
shuvo san: **Reasearch note** are not only about success but also about how the failure happen otherwise it can be happen again and again. Research notes are about how to carrying out the research, what problem are we facing like this kind of things. The research discussion with Iftekhar san, the notes on the scheen , we will start from the research summary. He said that the meeting was started from the research summary and finding some conference for submitting the paper that he needs. Sensei does not see any effort from the research notes, and Ifetekhar said that he had some difficulties from the job hunting activities, such as the web test or SPI and also finding some companies. Sensei said that at least please also write those things to be the written in the research notes, and yeah I think it is also important even it is not related to the research. Sensei said, okay we will try to write from now but in 3 weeks with no research notes, it is not a short times.
Writing wrong fact or misslead factor, in research note is prohabited.

## 24.2.19

I was trying to read some basic concept of simulation, like what is simulation , the creation of a model than can be manipulated logically to decide how the physical world works, simulation answer questions. I have started to seeing a sassion on modeling and simulation. 

## 24.2.20 *LM*

Sensei says not to come campus on next sunday. Next week sensei will go nogoya as well as hokkaido, may be he will cancel the tour and the session can run ok . And next next week 5 march maybe there will no meeting or the relocation the meeting time. And Next month sensei have some bisuness trip, and there will some relocationg of session time. And in 12 march there will be no meeting because there will be an entering exam, and for busy schedule may be there will be no relocation of the meeting. This is the briefing of schedule of this month and next month. And april there will be deadline for the internationl conference.

Todays meeting started with suma san. Sensei asked her what are the issue is she facing according her research and job hunting issue, that will be very helpful for masters first grade student. 
obstacle in the parking lots? while we are making a simulation of basic parking lot where new obstacle may be face, like we can skip complicated obstacle. Suma san actually facing the problem about visualization, like who are going to get benifits.
Fairness in resource allocation and fairness while 2 persons have same problem - who getting beinifits
- We may not be clear/have no way to analyze what is actually happening. To analyse what is happening we should know
- If we apply some reinforcement tech-then the log data may be small.
- If the output data is small, then we may not worry about the visualisation.
- We don't know where to start is the difference between bachelors and masters.
In Masters course there will be some complicated terms and experiment and thats why sensei is there to help us, but first students must leam something so they give us enough chances. And then we have discussions We may first have to have failures while doing something to learn. But those failures is good for better learning.
Suma san have some issue including fairness after discussion with kawai san, like how does the fairness can be conducted ex in case someone disable and a pregnant women and first camer driver in a parking lot how does it can be determine whos gonna take the parking space>  what is completely unfair? in some cases we clearly see what is unfair and how we can adjust them.

## 24.2.26

I was trying to read some basic concept of simulation, like what is simulation , the creation of a model than can be manipulated logically to decide how the physical world works, simulation answer questions. 
Also trying to read nihongo, trying to understand basic conversation skill. 
- I am confused about my research, As I don't have any previous experience in research. After joining meetings and reading some papers of our lab members, I found a pattern of addressing a distinct challenge related to the domain of interest. They propose a specific problem, followed by presenting a solution or comparing their ideas with previous work. I understand the importance of having a specific problem statement in my proposal ? However, I'm unsure about how to identify such a problem or what steps I should take in this situation.

Next week sensei will go nogoya as well as hokkaido, may be he will cancel the tour and the session can run ok . And next next week 5 march maybe there will no meeting or the relocation the meeting time. And Next month sensei have some bisuness trip, and there will some relocationg of session time. And in 12 march there will be no meeting because there will be an entering exam, and for busy schedule may be there will be no relocation of the meeting.

Talking with **sabbir san** : IN His code  he assigned static object randomly as it was a room model and movable object have a free position. Based on pygame library function he already assign some time interval and based on these time Interval our movable object run one place to another place
he also assign some static path for movable object.
Based on his current simsulation scenario, he can reproduce an updated version from here like updated version should include some static obstacle in random position or fleed position. he want to have also some fixed path for moving olject from one place to another place in this current situation without collision avoidance our movable object running smoot

-Dreadlock and colision arddance tutaly afferent things but thens may be some small connection In his research the suction mechaniem may not be sufficient to ratoris condock soue in me situation

To avond the deadinck issue we have actually two options, The
- We can use some deadlock avoidance agorthm 
- We can do nothing for this deadlock condition
Sabbir san wanted to use aution mechanism for his simulation, and sensei suggested that if deadlock situation happen maybe that will be care of another way not help of aution mechanism, because aution mechanism is not used for this type of problem.
- It can be haldle manually , like we can told in the code like if/else condition, and no need to think about it right now.
- what can be happen if we try to do something, 

Talking with **shuvo san** :
For His simulation need to code for range prediction. he has some issues with making code and he tried to find this kind of code.He thinks next step is range prediction but it's not correct, after range prediction, he will try to do the best CS selection step. This is his maybe he may have other issue but he does not clearly understand it.
**"Toward an Efficient Electric Vehicle Charging Place Booking System using Multiagent Learning"**, is the title for his paper.

I was trying to read some basic concept of simulation, like what is simulation , the creation of a model than can be manipulated logically to decide how the physical world works, simulation answer questions. 
Also trying to read nihongo, trying to understand basic conversation skill. 
- I am confused about my research, As I don't have any previous experience in research. After joining meetings and reading some papers of our lab members, I found a pattern of addressing a distinct challenge related to the domain of interest. They propose a specific problem, followed by presenting a solution or comparing their ideas with previous work. I understand the importance of having a specific problem statement in my proposal ? However, I'm unsure about how to identify such a problem or what steps I should take in this situation.

## 24.4.30 **LM**

In my proposed model, I mentioned multiple agents will be designed to perform specific tasks related to traffic control, such as traffic flow prediction, congestion detection, traffic signal optimization,
and *accident identification*.<br>
Thease can be a individual probelm to solve.Like now i thinking to narrow the initial problem statement, this thing i am planning as sevaral module , 
In first module there will be done traffic flow prediction for an x street, <br>
Then second module , ??<br>
For Smart traffic light control, Initially it will be controlled with perspective of two value time and number of cars,following x waiting time.How to done it dynamically?

<img title="initial idea" alt="Alt text" src="/home/rafz/Documents/Informatics_Lab/WhatsApp Image 2024-04-30 at 1.34.09 PM.jpeg" width="400">

Next week there will be no meeting.
**Disscussion with me** <br>
Research is not a problem solving, When we do some problem solving we do some research. The main focus is to learn from the lab.Sometime strong belive is not correct.For now it is ok for learning new things. But in some case it should have some counter question,arguments.
Research question doesn't mean problem statement- For understading the research .
Ask others about most effective way is important,
What can we do for it? - what can we for some specification statement?
Difference between mockup and handsketch or ppt- From the mockup we can think different perspective, and the research question will be understandable by everyone.

When we want to learn something new we should be confused, if i always beleive on my own belief maybe its not right all the time. I would be confused untill passed masters grade.

## 24.5.13

I am trying to solve one problem from leetcode everyday. 
From the last meeting sensei suggested to make a mockup for the research for better understanding, and other perspective can be arise some good research question.
Not using ppt!
He also suggested not to use ppt for mockup, i asked my seniors they have done their mockup using ppt, i am planning to doing it using pygame and now i am trying to understand the basic concept of pygame first. I was seeing a journal,"Smart Traffic Light Using YOLO Based Camera
with Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" i saw some figures and got an modeling idea for my mockup but i am not sure about it.



## 24.5.14

Next Next week our meeting will be skiped. From 28 there will be a conference JASAI, sensei will be busy. From june our meeting will be just on time.

About **Research Note**: 
The thing i remember from the last time, **Reasearch note** are not only about success but also about how the failure happen otherwise it can be happen again and again. Research notes are about how to carrying out the research, what problem are we facing like this kind of things. Sensei said that at least please also write those things to be the written in the research notes, and yeah I think it is also important even it is not related to the research. Sensei said, okay we will try to write from now but in 3 weeks with no research notes, it is not a short times.
Writing wrong fact or misslead factor, in research note is prohabited.

Sensei told to **Toufik san** :
As a human being we cant remember all that happen with us with date and time, but if we write down everything maybe we can recall.
Also writing research note we can monitor our work we are doing , if its blank it can make ourself ashamed that we havent done anything, Its a reminder for us that how much time we are giving in research prerspective.
Reading a paper and we should to write it on research note, and if we are confusion about anything thats a problem we can talk about with sensei.
Sensein suggested not to read some paper not to understan something, and those paper have some concreate goal.
Result part have no connection with mockup, we have some expected result. And sensei suggested,
***Dont beleive in your beleving***
In the **conclusion part** two thing can be mentioned like , what result we are expecting, what we are dreaming to do and the result we will actually get from the result. At my understaning Research never concluded, it can and will be improved continiously. In conclusion sort clear goal. 

**Disscussion with me:**
Simpler desing for mockup, text base or rectangle, for initial mockup. Maybe in later time animation can be the final mockup. When we can do some text base mockup , we can also do more clear visualization. For now text base mockup is best thing.I thought maybe its the final mockup , that was the problem. 
Writing something on my paper can relax me ,**sometime doing parallal work is good thing.**
Expected situation is to see the expanded time for the greater cognation side of the road and it 
What the other aspect we can think of about traffic management ?
what can be done for high speed car ?
For emergency case like ambulance passing what can be done in traffic management ?

Data from some road?

## 24.5.15

  - For the drunk drivers how it is helpfull to follow the lights?
  - Mid Night drivers drive rushly, can something be done about it?
  - Can the accident be reduced ? or accident can be identified?
  - After accident the emergency help time can be reduced?
  - Can the collide car or rule breaking car can be identified through this system?
  - Traffic police or man power what will their role?
  - If weather collapse like heavy rain or snowfall how does the system react?
  
  

## 24.5.21 **LAB MEETING**

## 24.6.1

I have joined todays job fair in act city and visited 7 companies. This is new to me, may be i will do internship in some companies. And I visited company they work with compression of images, their compression ratio is near 40 to 50 % but image quality seems same.

## 24.6.2




## 24.6.3

I have two class today i missed the nihongo class, then i came to lab the next class had a assignment but i didnt understand , and i asked takahashi san to help me and there was a disscussion meeting around 1 p.m to 3 pm for the Information organization class. In this week there was seven assignments, too much pressure. And then nigongo practice so many things. 
About my research i am trying to read a paper,"Multiagent Decision Making For Maritime Traffic Management"
As far i can think of some research question,
  - For the drunk drivers how it is helpfull to follow the lights?
  - Mid Night drivers drive rushly, can something be done about it?
  - Can the accident be reduced ? or accident can be identified?
  - what can a agent do after accident?
  - After accident the emergency help time can be reduced?
  - Can the collide car or rule breaking car can be identified through this system?
  - Traffic police or man power what will their role?
  - If weather collapse like heavy rain or snowfall how does the system react?
  
  
## 24.6.4 **LAB MEETING**

From next week sensei will have class at 4pm, From next meeting there will be divided into two time one will be same as this time and another will start from 5.40 pm. Last meeting was about domestic conference, Sensei was working as local organizing, 

**Telling others people about the research- dont try too much to make them understand rather try to show some mockup or work or prove what you are doing. And explain your condition and you are unable to speak in japanease in japanease they will understand that atleast you are practicing.** 

## 24.6.5

Today i have nihongo class and there is a job fair in the afternoon . And i am planning to go there, i meet several compinies Suzuki , senkei as my understanding now i should focus on nihongo much. Then i came to lab and tried to do some problem solving. this semester there are too many assignments, like everyday has atleast one or two assignment.

## 24.6.6

There are two classes in the morning. I missed one cause i am not feeling well. I have two assignments deadline to meet today. About research i am trying to search some new paper. Tomorrow i have nihongo class test i tried to practice so hard , this semester there is so much pressure and in couldnt fully concentrate to nihongo, i find it hard to leave something for next day.

## 24.6.7

Today i have nihongo class test, it was hard for me i hardly can pass in this exam, now i understand a little nihongo but for reading and speaking i have to practice more and more. Then i have arubaito from 5pm to 10pm.

## 24.6.10

Today is monday, i have two classes and two assignment to submit. I missed the nihongo class last night i slept late , the assignments was much hard to crack. I came to lab after finishing the class. And i am planning to apply for a schoolarship, i tried to fill the documents and i asked mizutani san for help. Then i tried to read a report "A traffic light control method based on multi‐agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm".
And i tried to write the abstraction and conclusion in my paper. 

## 24.6.11 **LAB MEETING**

**Recap from the last meeting(24.5.14) and my current situation:**
Sensei suggested to do creat initial mockup, and practice parallal working. sensei give some hint about, i was not clear last day about current situation like expected resul would be not only to see the expandaed time for the greater cognation side of the road. also suggested to think other aspect can be think about traffic management.

I am thinking about some research question,
  - For the drunk drivers how it is helpfull to follow the lights?
  - Mid Night drivers drive rushly, can something be done about it?
  - Can the accident be reduced ? or accident can be identified?
  - what can a agent do after accident?
  - After accident the emergency help time can be reduced?
  - Can the collide car or rule breaking car can be identified through this system?
  - Traffic police or man power what will their role?
  - If weather collapse like heavy rain or snowfall how does the system react?

Next meetings update,

This meeting will go on till 3.50 and then if it is necessary the meeting will be continued againg from 5.45.
**About Thesis:** sensei suggested not to use microsoft doc, which Style? The best way to start writing theasis is not to think about it rather started writhing, In thesis it is important what i have i done not what have accomplished or the explanation.
Sensei suggested to think about research question daily not more than one hour quontiniously.

Presentation of Suma San:
What is fair allocation? Fair allocation - FOF
Need basis fairness, Group fairness, Hybrid approches combines mulple fairnaess criteria or integrate them with other objectives such as efficiency or overall welfare.
Difficulty of determinig fairness?
A decision that seems fair and equitable to one group may be viewed as unfair by other - this is drawback 
- Can LLM effectively determine the fairness?
- as input the situation as natural language explanation go as the input and as ouput natural language
- No proper judgement from the top used LLM
- About the simulation in what basis according to fairness - need basis fairness?
- OLLAMA - Promt engineering as input please tell in one word that is it fair or not
- Main movite for this research how the LLM response to the fiarness and unfairness.

The main purpose of AI is to thinking  as like human, Is it really possible to achive fairness through LLM?

Suggestion : how difficulties we faces doing the researches it can be included

Presentation of shuvo San:
working on charging place allocation uning multi agent there is two part
- Imagine we are going somewhere from hamamatsu to tokoyo on a electric viacle. And we can be sort of bettery.how is that situation. this paper introduces a smart charging navigation system for long distance EV travels.

Presentation of sabbir san:
Parallal task allocation in multi robot environment based on auction mechanism with deadlock constrains.
Imagine in automated warehouse where various types of robots are responsible for different tasks, such as picking items from shelves, transporting them to packing stations, and managing inventory. each robot is equipped with specific capabilities and is tasked with performing multiple jobs in parallel to optimize productivity. The challenge arises when multiple robots need to access the same narrow aisle or pick items from the same shelf simultaneously, leading to potential deadlocks and inefficiencies.
This paper we are working  to achive parallal task allocation in multi robot environment erasing deadlock situation using auction mechanism. we are trying to find some deadlock situation and tried to suggest some algorithm for we have used itterative auction mechanism.

## 24.07.23 **Lab meeting**

Disscussion with soma san:
Her problem is that she cant use ollama in some cases(with the mac mini in the lab), in order to run some large model like command r plus And when in tried to run via LMStudio which is prepared unig vnc. I cant use the copy paste function. As i need to give the input of car parking situation s generated she can t use this models.
So the things she confirmed for this issues, capy paste of virtual lmstudio is disabled becauses of the option s she have selected while installing.
- the large models which are unable to run via alllama is the issue of ollama, so even if she wants to observe some data from there.

Disscussion with sabbbir san:
**What is your controbution to your work or your research?**
How many approch you have tried to solve dead lock situation.
- we can prepare one or more approch for the research and then compare the result and show it and can say which one is better and our originality.

Disscussion with shuvo san:


About research contribution, As far disscussion with sabbir san i think we should compare our approch with some existing approch that will prove our contribution.
**May be seeing the potential of multiagent system in the booking sytem and the optimal route selection.**


**Discussion with me:**
Tittle for my presentation - "Toward a Multi-Agent Approach for Dynamic Traffic Control and Optimization"
my interest for now is to seeing the potentiality of multi agent system for post accident senario. 

Think about the EV- automatic cars for obstacle detection.

## 24.07.24

I followed sensei's hint and searching some papers on obstacle detection for automatic vechile.
"3D Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars using a
Multi-Camera System: Calibration, Mapping,
Localization, and Obstacle Detection"
Keywords: Fisheye Camera, Multi-camera System, Calibration, Mapping,
Localization, Obstacle Detection
This paper mainly focuses on the ability to sense cars surroundings, the 3D variant of this problem : estimating the 3D structure of the environment around the car and exploiting it for tasks such as visual localization and obstacle detection.

## 24.07.25

The problem with my current research that research questions actually have the potentiality to being researched. I tried to read another paper,
"Real-Time Multi-obstacle Detection and Tracking Using a Vision Sensor for Autonomous Vehicle"

## 24.07.26

"Detecting Unexpected Obstacles for Self-Driving Cars:
Fusing Deep Learning and Geometric Modeling" [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06573) - <br>
addressed problem with a vision system that leverages appearance, contextual as well as geometric cues.

## 24.07.26

Investigating Driving Interactions: A Robust Multi-Agent Simulation
Framework for Autonomous Vehicles, [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04720)

Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Collision Avoidance of Autonomous Driving System for Vulnerable Road User Safety [link](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/10/1952)
The hybrid A* path searching algorithm is first applied to calculate a pre-defined path marked by waypoints, and a low-level path-following controller is used under cases where no VRUs are detected. Upon detection of any VRUs, however, a high-level DRL collision avoidance controller is activated to prompt the vehicle to either decelerate or change its trajectory to prevent potential collisions.

## 24.07.29
 Obstacle detection and avoidance for automated vehicle: a review, [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12596-020-00676-6#Abs1) :One of the initial approaches was by using ultrasonic sensors and laser range scanner and was adopted with acceptable accuracy. But as the camera applications geared up with their advances in types and sophistications, a pair of camera or stereo vision has geared up for this application.
 "Multiple Obstacle Detection for Assistance Driver System Using Deep Neural Networks :" [link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24271-8_45)
 they propose a deep convolutional networks for solving the online multiple obstacles detection problem. The method consists of deep visual information extraction and visual pattern learning. They are modeled as deep Convolution Neural Networks, which are able to learn discriminative visual features for obstacle detection and model inter-object relations in an asymmetric way and give the orientation extraction for the moving obstacles.
"Obstacle Detection and Distance Estimation for Autonomous Electric Vehicle Using Stereo Vision and DNN": [link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-3393-4_65)
This can be achieved in multitude of ways such as using passive sensors like camera and applying vision algorithms on their data or using active sensors like RADAR, LIDAR, time of flight (TOF). Active sensors are costly and not suitable for use in academic and research purposes. Since we have advanced computational platforms and optimized vision algorithms, we can make use of low-cost vision sensors to capture images in real time and map the surroundings of an automobile. In this paper, we tried to implement stereo vision on autonomous electric vehicle for obstacle detection and distance estimation.

I have one class of software engineering today, there is a last assignment.

In last week i got hint from sensei and i tried to read some paper about that topic. My current situation is i am confused that i asked suma san , takahashi san about the hint.have sensei give me the hint for changing the research theme, soma san replied she was actually busy with her thesis last week and didn't followed much.
Takahashi san said sensei taught me about importance of "WHAT" and "curiosity".
Sensei knows "curiosity" of research community and can judge your research topic would be accepted or not so welcome.And also said he didnt take enough volume of note to remember the details of you and sensei's last discussion.

For now i am confused ? i find more curiousity with this theme of obstacle detection for self driving vehicle . 

## 24.07.30 **Lab Meeting**

29-31 august there will be mid term presentation, this could be early morning schedule. September first week sensei will have an workshop in hiroshima prefecture.

Discussion with me :
He is very confused.
Sensei question - What kind of issues he has about his research title.
Instead of saying - what should you do => change “should” to “can” i.e., what can i do
He thought he would get some ideas from the papers => so, he started to read them.
Before reading those papers, did you prepare some questions on reading those papers?
Why are you willing to have the brief summary of the content of the paper - the summary is already there in the abstract. You can directly copy and paste the abstract if you just want a summary. It is very easy and accurate.
Before making a checklist it is also necessary to check the background of the paper like where it comes from - don't read papers randomly.
Where this paper comes (the paper he is reading now) . how you reached this paper. Why do you believe this paper is nice to read?
Don't search your papers. See papers that come from top conferences.
Usually people search by keywords,  but recently published papers don't include the keywords.
The one he is reading is not a research paper rather a summary of what is happening in the field. From such things we don't have any way on how to organize our research.
Instead of searching - see the recently published state-of-art.
What issues are you having in your presentation title?
Your research title is very general but doesn't include the details of your research. So, I told you in the last lab meeting to concentrate on the details of your research.
The issue is - we mentioned nothing more details.
The situation in different cases is different. How many cases/scenarios are you written in your research?
He showed some questions but still these are less detailed and very general - for eg, reg drunk and drive - are they having family/nt, what kind of car he is driving etc.,
When you ask someone about these details then they can answer or give some more details to you.
Those details can be utilized to do some mock ups.
It is necessary to clearly evaluate those all ⅞ instance cases.

For mockup first think about the detailed senario, like What kind of car, the Road details.

## 25.07.31

The classes are over, in this week there are three last assignment for this semester.

## 24.08.1

In last meeting we talked about the situations and i wanted to chage my research theme but sensei told that i should work on the research questions first like make more detatils about the senario, that i am working on currently, The research question currently i am focusing on 
 - Can the accident be prevented ? or accident can be identified?

How a multi-agent system (MAS) can help for real-time accident preventation or obstacle detaction in **autonomous car**. 

## 24.08.2

In in my home country a civil war is happening between the unarmed students vs armed government army. Many innocent people are dying , this happening for like half of a month. But for now it happenig so brutally and many of my friends got died and injured in the protest. I am not feeling well mentally.

## 24.08.5

Today Bangladesh got victory against the facist government and so many unwanting event is happening in my country. I am happy and sad at the same time.

Last meeting summary:
What issues are you having in your presentation title? -The issue is - we mentioned nothing more details.
The situation in different cases is different. How many cases/scenarios are written in my research
 - some questions but still these are less detailed and very general 
 - for eg, reg drunk and drive - are they having family/nt, what kind of car he is driving etc.,
 - When you ask someone about these details then they can answer or give some more details to you.


## 24.08.6 **LAB MEETING**

Our midterm presentation might be happen in 29 august at the morning shift.

With multi agent approch even we cant decide this approch is optimal for the solution.                                                                                                     
Last meeting summary:
What issues are you having in your presentation title? 
- we mentioned nothing more details about the research senario.
- How a multi-agent system (MAS) can help in real-time accident preventation or obstacle detaction for autonomous car. 
Next question, how can we do it?  having seen some example, We need some complete example senario. After seen some complete senario then we can genaralize them. After genaralizing them then i can find some way to solve the senario.
How can we do some detailed senario for them ?
Thinking about good example is not easy, dont try to produce from your imagination, it would harm. 
If you worry about your future,
Having some short disscussion with others
another way is only observing by yourself, if you find something them take memo.
when we try to make good example we should start from bad example. Try a little better example step by step. 

Talking with soma san:
What i actually want to doing with obstacle detection like only detecting the obstacle, because there has been some technology they have already detecting the obstacle.
  - the existing obstacle detection technology has some range
  - i am wanting to detect obstacle for autonomous cars for accurate finding
  - next existing obstacle detection technology, how do they operate
  - what are the obstacle detection technology for autonomous 
  - what i really wanted to do after detecting the obstacle 
  - it can be used post accident senario to alrming the upcoming cars: then there should be inter communication system.
  - Obstacle detection for parking lot: normal car can detect obstacle in parking lot how
  - i can detect obstacle then what?
  -

ADAS- Advance

- Level 0: No Automation: The driver performs all driving tasks.
- Level 1: Driver Assistance: The vehicle can assist with one or more driving functions (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning).
- Level 2: Partial Automation: The vehicle can combine two or more driving functions (e.g., adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist), but the driver must remain engaged and ready to take control.
- Level 3: Conditional Automation: The vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in certain conditions, but the driver must be ready to take control when requested.
- Level 4: High Automation: The vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in most conditions, but human intervention may still be necessary in some situations.
- Level 5: Full Automation: The vehicle can handle all driving tasks under all conditions without human intervention.

While the concept of a fully autonomous vehicle (Level 5 on the SAE scale) is captivating, the reality is that we are not there yet.

**Research Question:**
1.  Addressing complex ethical scenarios that autonomous vehicles may encounter, such as choosing between different potential victims in a collision.For example, an autonomous vehicle might need to decide whether to swerve to avoid hitting a pedestrian, potentially risking a collision with oncoming traffic.

Challanges for now:
- Sensor Fusion: multi-sensor data fusion, sensor calibration, sensor uncertainty
- Perception: object detection, object tracking, semantic segmentation
- Path Planning and Control: motion planning, trajectory generation, vehicle dynamics
- Human-Machine Interaction: human-robot interaction, driver behavior, trust
- Simulation and Testing: virtual environments, simulation platforms, hardware-in-the-loop
  
Definition of **sensor fusion** in the ai context: In the AI context, sensor fusion epitomizes the cross-disciplinary approach of combining information from diverse sensors – such as cameras, radars, LiDAR, and ultrasonic sensors – to create a unified, comprehensive understanding of the environment. By fusing data from these varied sources, AI systems can foster higher levels of situational awareness and decision-making capabilities

## 24.08.8

Challanges:
1. Detecting small objects like children, debris, or potholes can be challenging, especially at higher speeds.
2. Incorrectly identifying objects as obstacles (false positives) or failing to detect actual obstacles (false negatives) can lead to safety issues.
3.  Effectively combining data from multiple sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar) to improve detection accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.
4.

## 24.08.12
About Waymo, Before our Waymo Driver begins operating in a new area, we first map the territory with incredible detail, from lane markers to stop signs to curbs and crosswalks. Then, instead of relying solely on external data such as GPS which can lose signal strength, the Waymo Driver uses these highly detailed custom maps, matched with real-time sensor data, to determine its exact road location at all times.

Lidar: 
Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, paints a 3D picture of the vehicle’s surroundings. Lidar sensors are located all around the vehicle in order to send millions of laser pulses in all directions, then measure how long it takes for them to bounce back off objects. No matter the time of day, our lidar system gives the Waymo Driver a bird’s eye view of what’s around.

Camera:
Our cameras give the Waymo Driver a simultaneous 360° view around the vehicle. They are designed with high dynamic range and thermal stability, to see in both daylight and low-light conditions, and tackle more complex environments. They can spot traffic lights, construction zones, and other scene objects, even from hundreds of meters away. There are 29 cameras on our Jaguar I-PACEs.

Radar: 
Radar uses millimeter wave frequencies to provide the Waymo Driver with crucial details like an object’s distance and speed. Radar is effective in rain, fog, and snow.

Brain: 
As the “brain" of the Waymo Driver, our onboard computer combines the latest server-grade CPUs and GPUs. It takes information provided by dozens of sensors on the car, identifies the different objects (like other cars and pedestrians), and plans a safe route towards your destination – all in real time.


First what i am planning to doning -> research background -> research motivation -> motivation senario? ->

## 24.08.13

Sensor fusion is a main challange for dteecting obstacle and here in proposing multi agent approch like output from different sensor will be haldled by multiple agents and a certralized agent will take the main decision.


## 24.08.14

How an LLM-based system could potentially handle this:

1. Context Integration: The LLM could integrate information from multiple sources (visual inputs, traffic rules, construction zone protocols) to understand the overall context.
2. Reasoning: It could reason about the hierarchy of traffic controls (e.g., worker gestures may override malfunctioning lights).
3. Generalization: Even if not explicitly trained on this exact scenario, the LLM could generalize from its knowledge of traffic rules, construction zones, and safety protocols.
4. Human-like Interpretation: It could interpret the construction worker's gestures in the context of road work, even if they're not standard traffic signals.
5. Cautious Approach: The LLM could generate a conservative plan that prioritizes safety, such as slowing down, attempting to establish clear communication with the worker, and proceeding with extreme caution.
6. Explanation Generation: The LLM could provide clear reasoning for its decisions, which could be crucial for post-incident analysis or real-time communication with passengers.


## 24.08.15

Why multiagent is our choice?
- Each agent focuses on a specific task (e.g., object detection, path planning), making them highly efficient.
-  In a multi-agent system, decision-making is distributed across several agents, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and allowing the system to respond more flexibly to changing conditions.
- Agents can collaborate, sharing information and coordinating their actions to achieve a common goal.
- 

## 24.08.16

I am trying to make a presentation that includes a novel approach to autonomous driving systems by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) as the main decision-making agent within a multi-agent framework.
And i about the senarion i am thinking about false positive and false negative.


## 24.08.19

Last meeting recap: we mentioned nothing more details about the research senario,how can we do it?  having seen some example, We need some complete example senario. After seen some complete senario then we can genaralize them. After genaralizing them then i can find some way to solve the senario.
How can we do some detailed senario for them ?
Thinking about good example is not easy,dont try to produce from your imagination, it would harm. 
If you worry about your future,Having some short disscussion with others.

Short discussion with soma san:
What i actually want to doing with obstacle detection like only detecting the obstacle, because there has been some technology they have already detecting the obstacle.
  - the existing obstacle detection technology has some range
  - i am wanting to detect obstacle for autonomous cars for accurate finding, then what?
  - next existing obstacle detection technology, how do they operate
  - what are the obstacle detection technology for autonomous 
  - what i really wanted to do after detecting the obstacle


## 24.08.20 **LAB MEETING**

My current situation, I have prepared a presentation, the senario is kind of
a case of partial road construction or maintenance, that I often I see in road in japan , some pepole uses red and white flag to make signal its ok to pass or not they block the maintaince part with traffic cones.
What we human do in this kind of situation, - We use our common sense and pass through safe side.
What a  AV might do in this situation? -A typical autonomous vehicle (AV) might see the "STOP" sign and barriers and immediately come to a complete stop. It might interpret this as a full road closure, based on its pre-trained data.

Some informatin for near future, 
Next tuesday sensei is busy, there will be no meeting. Next wendesday, 8/28
**About the thesis**, there would be 3 submission date first is for comment from other sensei this could be change but submission to the administration the submission time are very firmly, then the version would be submitted to the campus file system this is prior final then if the commite will decide wheater it is ok or not. If it is ok then there will be no submission, otherwise there would be a final submission.


## 24.08.28

What toufik san really want to do is not mentioned in his presentation, sensei asked
"have you mentioned many supportive work and why you dont argue, are not market traders arent take any helps from others"
Distinguish between the belief and something is confirmed.
About the research isses where is the prove that you 

**CARLA** has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems.
CARLA: In addition to its core features, CARLA offers a framework for integrating V2X communication, allowing developers to simulate interactions between vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians.
AirSim: AirSim also provides support for V2X communication, enabling the creation of more realistic and complex urban environments.

## 24.08.29

About the question my goal: clear why using LLM , In such kind of scenario data driven model cant take decision what should to include human like reasoning we want to include LLM

For last two day there is a uncertain flood happening near my location, No continious electricity for preventing unwanted accident. I started the conclusion, this is my current situation.


## 23.10.24 

I am going back japan and in didnt join this lab meeting.

## 25.10.24

I just reached japan, i am trying to update my research paper soon i will upload this to the slack channel.
I am so much tired and sick this is my current sitution.

## 27.10.24

I am sick, i got fever may be the weather is changing thats why, i am taking rest actually. I asked toufik san and other first grade student about last lab meeting they told me sensei only talked with toufik san about how to write research note and asked him to make simulation for his work. Sensei also tell something about paper to toufik san but they remember not much. 

## 28.10.24

I am not fully well still, i planned to going on lab and have some small talk with takahashi san but i couldnt make it. I am writing research background now. ANnd planning to write also the methodology but maybe i should disscussed it with sensei first. Next meeting i will ask him. If i feel good tomorrow i will talk to takahashi san also.

## 29.10.24
Suggestion from takahasi san:
- More example is one idea to fullfillin the paper requirements. 
- about contribution of multiagent system for communication between vechiels think about VICS, 
-

Avoiding word like innovation,
13:14 Rafiさんの話
Why we use LaTeX is that, for every conference, they have a specific format of LaTeX.
教員はM1の留学生にも今日から書き始めろと指導した。
結論から書け。逆向きから書くという方法があるということを知っていること、それだけでも意味がある。
Conclusion can be written only by first author, while other part can be written by rest authors.
That's why we write papers from conclusion.
Here you are saying about innovation.
f. Can you define what is innovation?
r. Preparing solution?
f. Umm. So without having progress of technics? ...no.
Innovation という単語は研究ではなくて、ビジネスの世界で使われることが多い。
f. Knowing which terms are used in which field is important.
(introduction of "Make it Stick" book)
(to 1st grade M students)Since the time of master cource is limited,
I will strongly recommend you to start writing your paper at beginning of your cource.
How produce a paper is important regardless what output is.
Top conference: actual presentation deadline will come next May, while full paper submission is this month.
There is gap between submission and presentation.
Instead of that, **conferences** of IEEE (excluding A class one) are good challange for master grade students.
Ofcource, you(Rafi) can try this!
Which conference we are going to submit is other important issue.
(introduction of "IIAI AAI winter 2024" conference)
f. Length of paper is very important.
- 1st priority is writing up enough length of paper and then improve the quality.
- Don't use generative AI to write your paper.
- Don't copy and paste from other researches.
Sensei has been undertaking the risk of being included on the papers as the co-author.
(If first author's behabiour is not consice, next year students might be rejected too)

(Continue reading Rafi's paper(especially on conclusion part))
Solution -> Solution is not a progress technically.
Then to show something about it, we gonna show something regarding it.
e.g. we can obtain some level of benefit or drawback from LLM??
human-like reasoning?
Conclusion must be a conclusion. Answer must be included.
Most efficient way to brabrabra... is writing conclusion without any knowledge
and have such kind of discussion.
(for 1st grade master students)Start writing to start thinking about your research.
**repeated cycles** process of thinking about your research (not a single cicle of doing) is helpful.
Immidietly after you submit your paper, you can start next conference submitting paper.
Very actively working studnets did so.
He submit both of conference and workshop.
About figure, you should use copy licensed figure.

Why we have to submit international conference?
f. There are some reasons. One of them is final reviewers might not be a expert of the field
  and that is why they want to see some evidence to prove your paper has been accepted
  by the community members of related field.
---
(Re-show his plan presentation)
f. You showed somewhat difference between yours and current researches.
"Unsafe-unknown", in such a case... (missed)
possible issue on experiments:
  Are these unknown situations really unknown to us?
What happens on agents is really unknown.
During learning process, learning agents does not gain information.
You(Rafi) does not seem to want to do such approach.
f. What can we do?
f. Ask LLM directly?
Can be solution?:
  If we could ask LLM and quickly build up experiment situation based on its answer,
  then we can make situation event it's very difficult to realize.
f. Actually undergraduate student is trying to create child behavior.
In Japan, elementary school students go to school without any help by parents. Unexpected behavior of children.
f. Limitation: prepare unknown situation was hard.
  So we made **potentially unknown situation to agents** even while
  designer of the experiment already know about the situation.
  rest is what would be future work.
f. example story: child follows a ball
f. Then go to detailed question
  like this: "how to reproduce it in the simulation environment"?
Having some kind of prototypes / mockup to reproduce what we can reproduce situation.
e.g. zebra mark, passing person, children, etc. ← text representation is also OK.
You can write it as research objective saying what we will do next is ???
Writing program for experiment is another good point to start from.



In paper dont writing sort form like dont or wont -> do not.

## 1.11.24
- i will include the explanation of unknown unsafe 
- then some scenarions
- limitation and future work
- making some test case and result from gpt and add the images to the paper.
- 
Unknow-unsafe scenarios why complicated,
Happen without warning
Require immediate decision-making
Often combine multiple challenges at once
May not have been experienced before by the driver
Can overwhelm normal driving responses

## 4.11.24

At 2nd november the conference deadline is closed maybe this time i can not submit my paper.

## 5.11.24

About my research what i can do now actually this is my goes with my current situation.


## 6.11.24 **Lab meeting**

**Last lab meeting summerization:** Some good advices for everyone actually, LaTeX is used because each conference requires a specific format, so it’s best to start learning it early. It's helpful to start with the conclusion because it gives direction for the rest of the paper.Sensei advised first-year master’s students to start writing their papers now. Start writing early to help you think more deeply about your research.There are some reasons. One of them is final reviewers might not be a expert of the field and that is why they want to see some evidence to prove your paper has been accepted by the community members of related field.
- About figure, you should use copy licensed figure.
- Are these unknown situations really unknown to us?
  What happens on agents is really unknown.
  During learning process, learning agents does not gain information.
- Limitation: prepare unknown situation was hard.

**Toufik san:** Last time what disscussion happent to him, last time its about the research note - how to write research note, what should do readng new research paper. Then sensei suggest him to make him some simulation about his research
- what kind of mockup we have in my research 
- for example apple store based on some example
- then sensein suggest him to prepare him to make some mockup
  
In last last meeting i was not present, Sensei told about the importance of thinking about  "what i can do insted of what should i do"
We should think about what can we do. Sensei suggested him about some conclusion but toufik snas imaginary conclusion is far different from it. He is being stick with his believe without any confirm evidence. Its a serious problem. About sabbir san he believe his paper include problem formualation and conclusion should include some. 
Sensei suggested the first grade student to taking digital note insted of physical note, and still some of them taking note in physical manner, this is same situation with toufik san believing their own believe.

Summerize about the last meeting that could conclude what is the confusion, this could be helpful to push you further. For toufik sans metter the confusion is coming from the feeling thats why its hard to explain his current situaiton. He is thinking who whould be the user? Dont mix what is happening in market, but the marketers dont thinking about this rather that thinking what can be improve. Rather think about your procedures or alternatives what improvement can be done. We are  thinking like the marketers which option would be best from this 3 examples.

- thinking about the viewpoint of the users is very difficult. From the users side we dont want the best one, better one is ok. But as the producer we want the best solution. Checking all the possible other ideas. 
- Sensei suggested him to make a simulation for the first conditon, for a single buyer. And strongly suggest him to it from now.
- For the second case, the reviewers get gift card that will calculated buy a agent they will also get a discount. When the buyers going to buy phone after seeing the review, they will set a trashold value for buying the phone. Buyers and reviewers are different? - why
- We have invistigate the--MISSED , the future is evaluating the-- MISSED
  

Disscussion with new students,
Suggenstion from toufik san, Sensei suggested to update the research continiously note because it can be memorized, there should be a plan it can be changed but it just go on
- try to write nearly everything in research note
- making point would make less time to write the explanataion.
- Sensei suggested to use keybord to writing the note and ask some others if they miss something to taking note.

** Some Notice: **
Next saturday there will happen some event sensei suggested to join them.
There would be undergradute plan presenation in next thursday.
Entering exam for japanese student, where we cant come in campus.

## 7.11.24

Have some disscussion with toufik san and takahashi san about toufik sans research how can he explain his objective and he wrote some code as sensei suggested. 

## 8.11.24

About my research the IIAI conference i intended to submit my paper, the date is over . Then i have to be prepared for next conference.

## 11.11.24

Last updated research paper i tried to update some point that sensei suggested,
- I tried to  include the explanation of unknown unsafe 
- Then i added some new examples
- Limitation and future work, sensei give me some hint
- I planned to making some test case and result from gpt and add the images to the paper, but this was undone.

## 12.11.24

About my research i have updated my paper and didnt get any comment from sensei. For now i am waiting for some comment from sensei and then in next stage what can be done is the question.

**Disscussion with Sensei:**
Next thinking about some prototype, We really dont know our research outcome right now this is current issue?
The first step is to start writing code about the car crashing,
How can we make some knowledge to the cars,

Note from Hasan san, Firstly sensei listen rafi san’s present situation, sensei said sorry to him. Sensei told unknown situation   for car that is known to human . then sensei , told him to make prototype. He ask to sensei , what type of prototype he can make, then sensei told to follow mock up. First of all write some code that show some known and unknown  situation . then next step is  prototype to final simulation.In  Implementation  some situation with the code , though it hard but start to first some specific situation implementation,and it can be written in paper. And also listing up the worries topics that can be shown to sensei. If we stuck in some situation then we should  left  it for that time and reading some top conference papers. About it. Sensei emphasize to write research note.

## 14.11.24

Have some disscussion with toufik san and takahashi san about toufik sans research how can he explain his objective and he wrote some code as sensei suggested. 

## 15.11.24

About my research the IIAI conference i intended to submit my paper, the date is over . Then i have to be prepared for next conference.


## 19.11.24

About my research i have updated my paper and didnt get any comment from sensei. For now i am waiting for some comment from sensei and then in next stage what can be done is the question in last lab meeting i have started thinking about coding as the mockup. My confusion is why dont use a simulator like carla where the road situations are like real life wheres i am thinking to get some unknown senarios suggestions from the LLM. Then first i should start writing code for the initial then i can get suggestion from sensei.


## 20.11.24 **Lab meeting**

Last lab meeting summerization: Sensei suggested  me to do some prototype, From very beganing like car is running in a road then add some obstacle or accident senarios.
Simulate a car moving along a straight road with no interruptions. Focus on ensuring the car follows basic traffic rules, such as maintaining lane discipline and appropriate speed.

**Disscussion with toufik san:** What is important is starting from this one is easy for us then next step which part is updated - for initial part we used three categories of discount. In second step calculating some number from the random numbe. In scenarion section why you put some difficult portion. 7% off is given to the fist week selling customer, How the income is related to this? sensei didnt mentioned about the income in the second step he added this. Toufik san believe that it would be more compitable with real world wheres sensei suggest him to make simplified model. (About the treshold value i am not understanding)
When we think about complicated model -- we would think more simplified modeling though you can think it may be not be real world.  
And you have noticed coming to this point you had face difficult moments thats why research is not easy.
Again we are going to make this income as treshold.  then he is counting the person in the treshold then what the calculation do?
Their concern is the income of the seller. It is not focused to the buyer. Why dont you collect the data of the buyer. Why dont you calculated total sell from the seller? How much we can get from the selling that is our concern why dont you collect the data. This is the repeted disscussion whenever you see real life example you are satisfied.
Whats happening here you are not seeing the number you making realistic not randomly. When we rely on our feeling the output we want is more realstic, thats why we need to practice? while practicing we are not intend to going to the final step directly.
Underline efforts is not easy, actually he have to fighting against his felling its not easy.
First randomly --
You can calculate the discount ratio on it. 
we gonna see the second scenario, in second scenario he also didnt calculated the selling. Number customers who reviewers - whats missing? When you want you give some discount to the top reviewers this can violate the rules. 
In scenarios three, there are also three promotional offer, in this you are giving discount to the people who is using this media users why dont directly giving the money to the company.--
Having some disscussion with other research doing person talking with, how they are doing this could be nice to overcome with natural feeling.
The disscussion could be so serious to us to relax maybe the laboratory devices can relax us, what would be next step in your word - he can simplify think about the model.
The next step is to calculating the sellers income and add some treshold for the buyers.
Sensei suggestins, you can write a simple code in simple way throw away the real world. Even now hasan san is thinking about real world thats what preventing him to write a simple code .
you can write a simple code although it wont reflect the real world. Only writing the keyword may confuses you  wheather we want it or not.
While we are doing research we cant say which direction is right or wrong. Also next step could be writing this to your research paper.
Wheathers we confused about our content in our research paper is it ok or not. Thats why we need some comment from the reviewrs from the outside is nice. Dont expect to accept your paper in your initial version.

Even we the know importance though its difficult for us to do that. Sensei suggested the M1 to start writing their paper.

## 21.11.24

As last meeting i got some suggestion for making prototype of the mockup from the scratch and i write a code today that only a car manully can go forward and break and also can go right and left. 

## 22.11.24

Today after finishing prayer i came to lab for upgrading the prototype in v2 i am going to add one feature the car can go forward dynamically. Today i tried to do that may be i need some time for finish this. Sensei suggested me that after this i can add some features about some obstacles and so on.

## 25.11.24

About research i havent upgrade my prototype yet, still i am trying so many things happening acctually, mentally i am bit upset cant doing daily things.

## 26.11.24

I have tried to make a prototype where a single car in going forward dynamically.

## 27.11.24 **LAB MEETING**

Last lab meeting summerization: Sensei suggested  me to do some prototype, From very beganing like car is running in a road then add some obstacle or accident senarios.
Simulate a car moving along a straight road with no interruptions. Focus on ensuring the car follows basic traffic rules, such as maintaining lane discipline and appropriate speed.


Next step simulator: We would like to make these simulation ready for LLM, When the car is going and not having anything 
Implementing some obstacle and going through this may be good for some senarios. We
Next may be make some promt for LLM, hey LLM whats happening here.
Two following car one see the stop sing and stop and ask LLM what should the following car do? And adding some promt for the following car. What this car should do? Then check the LLMs reaction. And then check the answer.
In my paper This simple text base scenario, and asking LLM.
Connection between the simulator And the LLM -  some disscussion with undergrad student

**Note from Tauhid san:** Rafi-san told about his last discussion that sensei told him to make about prototypes. Rafi-san showed his prototype. Sensei told Rafi-san to make more simpler porotype as his prototype was bit complex. Sensei is happy with the prototype and asked him about his questions. Rafi-san asked sensei how can he take LLM decision. Sensei suggested him to take screenshot and asked him to implement the simulator with some character. Rafi-san asked sensei about CARLA simulator. In CARLA they already have a framework. Sensei asked him to show details about CARLA in website. Sensei - we don't know the validity about the CARLA simulation, whether its for research purpose or developed by some company. Takahashi - a paper related CARLA simulation was published in collaboration of Intel and TOYOTA. Sensei- as there is a paper so it may have some validation. sensei suggested Rafi san to choose the simulator independently and afterwards ask questions to sensei, so we may know the simulators are doing and how they works. There is trade offs that we have to go through the codes thoroughly which is very hectic and time consuming so sensei suggested to try new techniques. we can decide the kind of simulator by adding some more in the prospect. how LLM can capture the correct data. what are we going to do, we don't have a clear prospect so we need to try different simulations to identify the correct one. we must be careful about the tradeoffs while selecting a simulator. So better to have a own simple simulator. Before starting the simulation we worry about so many things and therefore we are here. And these can be happen with us and we must fight against our own feeling. One thing is clear we should ready the simulation for LLM and for unknown situations. In the simplest case car going straight is okay. the potholes must be detected by the car, detecting obstacles and go through it is one kind of scenarios, will the car go through the obstacle or stop ask the LLM.LLM prompts - one car going through, one car stops, what should the next car do? or car changing the direction what the next car should do. Think about the global scenarios. sensei told us about one of his such events. Are you worrying about writing some paper. You can add this things in the paper. Then why didn't you do it before 3-4 months back. Rafi san - I was thinking about what should I do then. We can use some powerful computers to implement the LLM. Some undergraduate students implemented the relation of LLM and powerful machine. We must have some Japanese kill to discuss with Japanese students. Japanese students are getting very little chance to show their speaking skills as they are not asked about their English skill in the entrance exam. We must have learned much Japanese last one year. We must regularly practice Japanese to develop our Japanese skill. The right Japanese skill is very powerful. You told about a good amount of issues. We must not stop writing research note in the meeting. It is hard translate some Japanese as there is no specific meaning in English. Bringing own drinks very important because it is very dry in winter. Try to enjoy this season. Enjoy the scenic view oh Hamamatsu.

## 28.11.24

In the last lab meeting, i got some comment from sensei
- We would like to make these simulation ready for LLM
- Implementing some obstacle and going through this may be good for some senarios.
- Having some disscussion with the others would be good
- 


## 29.11.24

I went to lab today, after finising my prayer i was plannig to think about my research, now i am thinking about the prototype where the problem can be clearly identified. Two car will colide in certain circumtances. I am plannig to join a job fair in the afternoon, maybe. 

## 02.12.24

I am sick i cant move my neck, thats why i lay down whole day.

## 03.12.24

Todat the neck pain is less still i am not feeling well.

## 04.12.24 **LAB Meeting**
 
**Disscussion with Toufik San:** Sensei asked toufik san what was the last disscussion and toufik san mentioned about the disscussion but there is no evidence about this, and asked him why he didnt ask someone 
for their notes. then Sensei asked his why didnt he do that, why is he just following his strictly follow his pesonal beleive. Then he replied he collected usually notes from others but last time it seems he had understad what sensei said. thats why he didnt ask.
What should be done only thats is written, what sensei suggested toufik san to use the text editor to make the research note but toufik san is not convinced.
Now toufik san successfully added his research note in text base. Toufik san at first he tried to use text base note but somehow he lost his data thats why started using google docs.

Sensei asked toufik san about the new finding from the others note, and suggested him to highlight some notes that whould be efficient for understanding what was his last disscussion. And he successfully he started thinking how he could reach next step not what would be the next step.

## 5.12.24

I have to make a simulation that can be a input for the LLM, Now what can i do i can check suma sans research documents for getting some idea.

## 6.12.24

Today is friday, after completing my prayer i came to room. Started thinking about how can be the simulation can be updated. I have some neck pain, i checked the pressure and its high.

## 9.12.24

I am so much tired for last two days i have done arubatio for like 18 hours, i am feeling not to do anything today. Also i have to go to Shizuoka tomorrow.

## 10.12.24

I have joined a job event in shizuoka, a company visit. It was a different experience we mistakenly brought the local trains ticket and faced most heptic train journey in my life.

## 11.12.24 **LAB MEETING**

**Last meeting Disscussion summarization:**
In the last lab meeting, i got some comment from sensei
- We would like to make these simulation ready for LLM
- Implementing some obstacle and going through this may be good for some senarios.
- Having some disscussion with the others would be good

My current situation for last one week i am feeling neck pain and i am so much puzzaled and tensed about job hunting and couldnt fully concentrate in my research tough i am feeling to do something avout my research. 
For now what can i do now.

**Some Upcoming informatin:** Sensei suggested to be careful about the infuelansa, this season the the air is too cold. 

We have a road and we have a car,what happen in our mind when we think its very simple to be done we dont do rather we think more difficult thing and when started work we couldnt complete, we fail. 
We sould do start from the simple way , dont skip the easiest one. Easy task skip, skip, skip, find difficult task, and then we just stop there.
Thoroughout the process, nothing have done.
What we think right now, the LLM can understand the complex scenarios but we are not sure whatever the LLM can understand the most easiest scenarios and can give expected output or not.


For japnease learning to make some note and try to speak it. Live conversation is most difficult, and most easiest way is to make memo what you want to say and say it again and again.

**Note from Takahashi san :** 20241211
13:17 Rafiさんの話
He created a very great simulation program.
f. Extending too much simulation what happen?
r. It is not best in order to create input to LLM.
(...after short talk)
f. First, research issue, and then go job hunting matter.
r. OK.
f. What kind of simulation are you going to implement?
r. Similar one with Sumasan ← Why don't you do it?
Easy task skip, skip, skip, find difficult task, and then we just stop there (=stack / pitfall).
Thoroughout the process, nothing have done.
Issue is just changing your simulation design into something LLM can understand.
Just change your design. Once you start to do it, then you can do it.
Facing the serious situation is important in master cource.
Unfortunately, other students cannot know how serious it is.
Learning Japanese is same manner just preparing Japanese sentences.
Don't skip easy thing. Utilize AI multilingal translation.
Show up content on your computer what you are willing and then Japanese will give hints.
(Rafi san has already prepared text-representation of simulation environment)
pasting text representation onto chat box of GPT-4o and ask him to whether he can understand it or not.
Then, LLM gave so complicated answer far from expectation.
f. add to prompt this "just answer STOP or FORWARD".
After updating prompt, LLM answered "STOP".
NP problem is different.
After noticing the problem, whether other problem's answer does not help another problem answer.
↑ ????
To whole students.
Share your knowledge about something related to research; for example prompt engineerina.
Others' insight can be helpful even if they don't have deep understandings on your specific research domain.
(↓some detail may missing)
Auto training E-to-E those company are developing AI to acheive that.
We don't have any cars! don't worry.
Utilize small LLMs can work well.
When receiving answer from LLMs which looks good, you don't stop there
but you have to think what the exact one you are willing to have and continue to ask.

**Note from Touhid san:** 11 December 2024 Wednesday
Sensei discussion with Rafi-san
Rafi-san discussed about the last meeting. Sensei told him about the last demonstrated model was very nice. 
Rafi-san told sensei that he was sick last week his blood pressure was a bit high. Sensei asked him about the progress of this week and told hom that the previous simulation was too much complex. 
*Rafi-san said this simulation is okay for visualisation but not okay for LLM.* 
Then Rafi-san told sensei about the job fair recently he visited and how was it and he also added that he talked about the versity recommendation with shirai sensei.
Rafi-san also told us about his company visit previous day. Sensei told us that these issues are also very important for us and we must continue learning Japanese language and increase proficiency. 
Rafi-san told that he is puzzled about the current situation and feeling great pressure and can't stable his mind. Sensei asked him about making a simpliest simulation. Rafi-san told us about suma-san thesis and how she implemented the code so Rafi-san also wants to make a similar kind of simulation. 
The point of msater's course is to face these type of difficult situations. Similarly we the first year master's student should also understand the pressure what Rafi-san going through. 
Sensei also suggested him to practice talking in japanese with japanese students. Rafi-san said he tries to speak in japanese but he faces difficulties in speaking Japanese so Sensei suggested him to use the smartphone and AI. Rafi-san also showed us how he is practicing Japanese using AI. 
He also told us about he sometimes don't understand the short forms of japanese in the conversation. Sensei asked us to start with the simple japanese words. So sensei suggested us to prepare the converstion brforehand so that we can speak fluently. We can have the similar kind of conversation more then once and so it will be easier for us in similar conversation we do. We can record some converstions for learning in the future. We are living in the era where we have many resources to learn. Rafi-san agreed and added that we also have many things to distract our focus in the wrong direction. Sensei again started discussing about RAfi-sans research. Sensei asked Rafi-san to use Ai to simulate a sitution regarding his research. Sensei asked rafi-san to promt different situation the GPT. Sensei asked him to modify the promt as it was written the natural language. This time the answer was right. So sensei told us that from this we can understand that what kind of command we need to put next and this is how we can use AI. AI is also working in a similar way as it is based on LLM so we can use it in some context but sometimes it is not easy. So sharing knowledge is very important. When we findnew things we must share it with others and research laboratory is such things. We can share experience with others which will also increase our experience. Sensei asked our japanese lab mates about the prompt engineering. Using generative AI in live converstions may be very effective in generating new ideas. Sensei told us about a group who are are trying to solve similar problem. At this point we are focusing on the car scenario so we must focus on LLM like bicycle or human scenario. SO we must not skip the necessary simple things and think about the kind of answer we want. Sensei discussion with japanese students.
Sensei asked us to visit Nagoya castle which is much bigger then Hamamatsu castle and Kyoto.

**Note from Fahmidul san** Today, Sensei discussed with Rafi-san that first Sensei tell him to briefly summarize the last discussion with him.Then Sensei again asked him what kind of issue he faces right now. He said he had a high-pressure problem.Sensei again asked, Please explain the details about so many. Rafi-san attended a job fair last week. Rafi-san is confused about everything. 
Sensei told us this information is also important for other students. Now Sensei is going to start a research-related discussion. Sensei told us that in our minds, easy steps we didn't follow, we just skipped that we worked the hardest thing, but we should think of easy steps first. What is important in a master's course to face some difficult situations? Rafi san has one year of experience. We have to fight against our deep feelings. Sensei asked him did he do it. Practice speaking Japanese with AI. Now he shows us he discussed with ChatGPT in Japanese. We are always going to start in the simplest way. For Japanese learning, make some notes and try to speak it. 
At the job-hunting program, we should prepare some basic Japanese sentences to speak with them.Practice speaking the same thing twice or more. Don't skip the easy thing. We are living in 2024, and 2025 is coming . We don't live in the 19th century; now we have computers and the internet. Don't start with the hardest way. Sensei told Rafi-san to ask ChatGPT for some traffic-related signs’ explanations. Sensei again told Rafi-san to ask ChatGPT to Please answer STOP or FORWARD. To get the right answer, ask the direct question.Once we find them, then we can utilize them easily.Once we found any unique things, we should share them with others.Other students don't have any knowledge about our research. Now, Sensei asks this question with some Japanese students in the Japanese language. Sensei speaks Japanese very fast. Sensei asked Takahashi-san is he noticed what Rafi-san did. Rafi-san didn't expect ChatGPT’s answer. Don't skip the necessary things. Even we receive simple answers. Now Sensei discussed with Mizutanikun-san in the Japanese language.

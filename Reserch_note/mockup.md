Senario: 
At a busy intersection during peak hours, a collision occurs between two vehicles. The accident disrupts the normal traffic flow, causing immediate congestion and potential secondary accidents. The traffic cameras capture real-time footage of the accident. These cameras are integrated with computer vision algorithms that process the visual data to detect anomalies, such as sudden stops, vehicle collisions, and traffic build-ups.
Agent 1: Accident Detection Agent
Action: The Accident Detection Agent receives the visual data from the traffic cameras. Using advanced image processing and pattern recognition techniques, it confirms the occurrence of the accident.
Reporting: Once the accident is detected, the agent immediately reports the incident's details (location, severity, and involved vehicles) to the Central Traffic Control System.
Agent 2: Traffic Flow Analysis Agent
Action: This agent analyzes the impact of the accident on the overall traffic flow. It uses historical and real-time data to assess the extent of congestion caused by the accident.
Prediction: The agent predicts potential secondary congestion points and evaluates the risk of further accidents in the vicinity due to the initial collision.
Action: Upon receiving the accident report and traffic analysis, this agent dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to mitigate congestion.
Coordination: It synchronizes traffic lights at nearby intersections to prioritize the flow of vehicles away from the accident site. This helps in reducing bottlenecks and maintaining smoother traffic flow in unaffected areas.
Central Traffic Control System:
Action: The Central Traffic Control System acts on the information received from the MAS agents. It executes the recommended traffic signal adjustments and implements additional measures like ramp metering on highways to control vehicle inflow.
Emergency Alerts: The system sends real-time alerts to emergency services, including police, fire departments, and medical responders, with precise details of the accident.

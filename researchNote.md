Sunday was funday and i have no class and i tried to get familiar with latex and successfully wrote an initial research prosal for todays (11.14.23)meeting. 

## 23.11.13

yes sensei last day was cold also. and i have two class to attend , one was in the morning at 8.00 am and the another was at 12.45 , that was your class.

## 23.11.14

writing research note is essential to remember to what happed last time and to remember the task we were assign last time. we can write anything that sensei suggested for practacing. 

Sensei tell us that at the beganing it will be difficult for us, and suggested to upgrade our typing speed, and strongly suggested to writhing the research note. sometimes we might we fail to write down some research note then ummmm ummmm today is not yesterday , sometime we have to write everything , that will be good practice, and strongly suggested to the past note. last day he forgot to write down his notes, he also write the past notes. wheather he remembers. suggest to put a date and write whatever we remember. asked us to write last date research note and not to be worried about past days and suggested to practice from now on. sensei showing us to how to write note propely.

**Poster presentation**
Sort time to describe the poster, and content is important , poster should be self contained, and understadable to the audience. Sabbir vai asked how to make understand the audience the background story?
Sensei told to prepare some live demonstration, or movies atlest prepare some laptop or tab.Sabbir san asked sensei to demonstrate a poster presentation,Sensei suggested to search some university poster presentation. Sensei mention about UMBC university.

## 23.11.15
I have one class that i misssed because i had a bad headec. And i have solved two problems in leetcode.

Next thursday is national holiday.<br>
[Workshop_on_Informatics](https://sites.google.com/view/winf2023/home),Deadline-last of this month.

Sensei suggested to take all classes before next march.13-14 of next january there will be entrance exam and we are strictly prohabited in campus.suggested to present on the presentation.
Sensei reviwed sabbir sans paper comment.

- [x] Sensei told us to convert our research proposal to IEEE format and  
- [x] Take research note properly.


## 23.11.28

**Conference && presentation GuideLine**
IIAI 2023 conference after the workshop.
Practice poster presentation as early as possible,and suggested sabbir san to start pesenting the poster. Practice to find the right content that should indicate the research theme. 
Do plan before write slide for any presentation otherwise that can miss some checking.
**Getting a plan is important before doing anything and thinking about what i am going to do** Research notes are important for improving to update the research things or anything assigned and this can be helpfull for the juniors for understading the situation how gonna the research should operate or any details about the situations.<br>**Before preparing slide for the presentation we need to do a proper plan, important thing is to getting a little bit prepare for the actual presentation.**
In conference presentation we dont have share our actual planning wheather we can share our planning after 6 months or after graduate what we gonnna do.Make some summarization about our presentation and what question can be asked is a good thing before presenataion,-getting comment from slack channel and answerig them can be a good way to preparaing for presenatation and we have to do crosscheck with our actual content. 
**To iftekhar san :** get comment from the audience can they relate the content with the actual theme or not. Some text explanation in poster is ok, some poster are for only for presentation and some poster need a presenter, ours gonna be secenond one. 

## 23.11.29

I was sick today , my pressure gone high , i rested whole day.

## 23.11.30

Today i have the first exam experience at japan , it was nihongo midterm exam. Though my preparation was not so good but i tried so hard and it is a relif. And i had only one class and then came to dormitory and cooked for myself.

## 23.12.1

I got an arubaito and today i have scheduled 7 to 11 am , then i have done my prayer at 12 pm and then i have a class at 12.45 and i joined that. There was a group presentation and my role was to time management , in which slide how much time need to use and which slide is just to show i tried to plan this out.

## 23.12.2

Saturday i tried to practice some nihongo , and watch one episode of "Jujutshu kaisen". I cooked for myself at night and practice nihongo at duolingo. 

## 23.12.3

Sunday there was no class , i woke up at 10 and try to learn some nihongo. And also i tried to solve a problem in leetcode but it seems hard and i became disapointeed and started watching a anime "Tokyo Revenge"

## 23.12.4

I have some work in eki , i wake up early and went to eki. Then i have a class or Data engineering but the class was cancelled at the last moment, i was in the class and wait sometime , then i have another class at 2.25, and make a group and choose a topic and in next class we do have a presentation.


## 23.12.5

**Sabbir San :** Presentation slided ,  at first page Add subject name and mention all the authors who helped to make sucess the research. Add more slides to explain some more things. **Poster presentation time is like 1 min, the main idea is to explain**, if someone asked more, there we could use more time. 
The main objective of his research is to identify an auction based approch that helps to create a paraller task allocation schedule vased one task preference  and path collision avoidance.
  - [ ] Novel methods can be developed to  proactivity detect and resolve and collision between robots in real time during task allocatin and execution.
  - [ ] Finding effective way to priotize tasks in multi robot task allocation system.
  - [ ] How the path planning algorithms be intregated.

At my understading it should be in this way like first problem statement -> Impletementation Design -> Limitation and Conclusion.

**Suma san :**Where to park the car? managing overstaying vehicles in parking lots , optimising efficiency of path planning : algorithm is used vest path finging algorithm
**Practice over and over untill it match the time expectation**

## 23.12.6

I have only one class today programming language, i missed two lecture, i tried to catch up , Sensei also give a review. I noted some key point and i think i can catch up. After the calss i came back home and tried to solve a problem in leetcode. And also practice some nihongo.

## 23.12.7

There was a nihongo class at 8.40 . I have joined it and i think 

## 23.12.8

I have done my prayer at 12 pm and then i have a class at 12.45 and i joined that. There was a session about yamaha company a guest lectuare tried to expline japanease work culture, hows important is mental health and how many holiday i can got after getting job. And there was a Session that says what gonna excite me in workspace.

## 23.12.9

I got an arubaito and today i have scheduled 9 to 2 pm, it was my first day without any trainer , it was hard undersatand their command but soon i catch up and it was a great experience.

## 23.12.10

Today there was an workshop Workshop_on_Informatics , many student was gathered most of them were japnease and some internatinal student. I went there and three of my senior presented their idea. Sabbir san, Shuvo san and Suma san. Sabbir sans idea is to develope a sytem where multiple robot on a supershop or factory can work under a centralized administration, if any task is assigned the robots will decide itself which work it will to based on shortest path finding avoiding collision with other robot , and if multiple task and multiple robot are assign they will do the same , first calculate for whom its efficient and then do the job, his presentation tittle was **Parallel Task Allocation in Multi-robot Environment under Uncertainty based on Auction Mechanism**. Next i visit suma san and her idea is to solve parking problem in parking lot according individuals choice. Basically she introduced a problem where if anyone wanted to park a car several issue arise like someone wants to park beside the main exit or close to bathroom, and how to manage those car which are parked for a long time and another thing if two or more car wanted to park in same which one get more priority. I think solving this problem is little bit tricky because our mind changes certainly.
Then i visi shuvo san, his idea is to find a path for electic viacle with available charging point based on if there is available point acoording my car battery life , can i use them or not because there will be a advance booking system. If there is more choice that satisfy the first condition then choose the sortest path. His idea is cool i think because i think in future there will be more electrical viacle and we need this kind of app or system. I also tried to understand other japanease students idea but their idea was written on japanease that i beraly understand and i asked if they can explain their idea but that dosnt work out. The presentation was closed at 2.15 and i came back to my room. It was really a great experience.

## 23.12.11

I have two classes today one was cancelled Data engineering and another class was in 2.25 pm and i have group presentation , describe a cyber attack happen in my country. I made a three page presentation about the incident Bangladesh bank Money heigst happend in 2016. 


## 23.12.12

International conference presentation is about 20 min. Sensei suggested sabbir san to to find out those question background those he get in wiNF by himself. The most question was like,
**why he use centralized auctioner insted of decentralized** In his research he planned conduct it **centralized auction based system** because he were planning to use a centralized server that will be responsible for task allocation and path planning. 

**How many robot you are planning to simulate in your model and if he simulate them how he is gonna do that** Initially his planning is to make a simulation based on few number of robot. After the simulation he will compare it with other researcher model and then take the decision.
Or this can be we gonna run multiple simulation taking different number of robot like 5 then 10 then 15 and we will compare the result and then we can go ahead to our actual planning.
**some ask about how to conduct the experiment, ask the evaluation technique**
Dont have to answer every question according out instinct, without backgruound knowledge its better not to answer all the question rather we can clarify what we can do about out experience.
**There should some limitation describe in the presentation slide** not own limitation but the limitation of the research. **answering the question , change the the slide to relevent slide and then answer the question,**

IIAI AAI 2024: [https://iaiai.org/conference/aai2024/]
shuvo san: Reasearch note are not only about success but also about how the failure happen otherwise it can be happen again and again. Research notes are about how to carrying out the research, what problem are we facing like this kind of things. The research discussion with Iftekhar san, the notes on the scheen , we will start from the research summary. He said that the meeting was started from the research summary and finding some conference for submitting the paper that he needs. Sensei does not see any effort from the research notes, and Ifetekhar said that he had some difficulties from the job hunting activities, such as the web test or SPI and also finding some companies. Sensei said that at least please also write those things to be the written in the research notes, and yeah I think it is also important even it is not related to the research. Sensei said, okay we will try to write from now but in 3 weeks with no research notes, it is not a short times.
Writing wrong fact or misslead factor, in research note is prohabited.

## 24.2.20 *LM*

Sensei says not to come campus on next sunday. Next week sensei will go nogoya as well as hokkaido, may be he will cancel the tour and the session can run ok . And next next week 5 march maybe there will no meeting or the relocation the meeting time. And Next month sensei have some bisuness trip, and there will some relocationg of session time. And in 12 march there will be no meeting because there will be an entering exam, and for busy schedule may be there will be no relocation of the meeting. This is the briefing of schedule of this month and next month. And april there will be deadline for the internationl conference.

Todays meeting started with suma san. Sensei asked her what are the issue is she facing according her research and job hunting issue, that will be very helpful for masters first grade student. 
obstacle in the parking lots? while we are making a simulation of basic parking lot where new obstacle may be face, like we can skip complicated obstacle. Suma san actually facing the problem about visualization, like who are going to get benifits.
Fairness in resource allocation and fairness while 2 persons have same problem - who getting beinifits
- We may not be clear/have no way to analyze what is actually happening. To analyse what is happening we should know
- If we apply some reinforcement tech-then the log data may be small.
- If the output data is small, then we may not worry about the visualisation.
- We don't know where to start is the difference between bachelors and masters.
In Masters course there will be some complicated terms and experiment and thats why sensei is there to help us, but first students must leam something so they give us enough chances. And then we have discussions We may first have to have failures while doing something to learn. But those failures is good for better learning.
Suma san have some issue including fairness after discussion with kawai san, like how does the fairness can be conducted ex in case someone disable and a pregnant women and first camer driver in a parking lot how does it can be determine whos gonna take the parking space>  what is completely unfair? in some cases we clearly see what is unfair and how we can adjust them.

I was trying to read some basic concept of simulation, like what is simulation , the creation of a model than can be manipulated logically to decide how the physical world works, simulation answer questions. Also trying to read nihongo, trying to understand basic conversation skill. I am confused about my research, As I don't have any previous experience in research. After joining meetings and reading some papers of our lab members, I found a pattern of addressing a distinct challenge related to the domain of interest. They propose a specific problem, followed by presenting a solution or comparing their ideas with previous work. I understand the importance of having a specific problem statement in my proposal, and there could be many unique problem statements related to my research theme like Adaptive Traffic Signal Control, Congestion Prediction and Avoidance, Emergency Response Coordination: designing agents specialized in detecting accidents or emergencies, and so on. However, I'm unsure about how to identify such a problem or what steps I should take in this situation.
